Slaad base. Lean into horror science station trope. Chaos in the first room, dead scientists wearing Fresenius Research lab coats. Find journal entries from junior scientist with increasing concern. Advance through rooms, find scattered Slaads and more dead bodies. Should be clear that Head Researcher slowly lost his mind and let them in. They find the head researcher in last room with junior from journal entries strapped to table, about to inject with final formula — Mind Flayer venom — like Slaad venom, it will turn victim into a Mind Flayer. Head Researcher is secretly a mind flayer.

## Introduction

TODO

Welcome to In Dire Need, a D&D Adventurers LeagueTM adventure, part of the official D&D Adventurers LeagueTM organized play system and the Storm King’s ThunderTM storyline season.

This adventure is designed for **three to seven 5th-10th level characters**, and is optimized for **five 7th-level characters**. Characters outside this level range can’t participate in this adventure. A player with an ineligible character can create a new 1st- level character or use a pregenerated character.

The adventure is set in the Hartsvale region of the Forgotten Realms, predominantly in the Ice Spire Mountains.

### Adjusting the Adventure

Throughout this adventure, sidebars provide information to assist you in making adjustments for smaller or larger groups and characters of higher or lower levels than the adventure is optimized for. This is typically used exclusively for combat encounters. These adjustments aren’t required, nor are you bound to the suggestions made by the adventure—they are recommendations provided for guidance and convenience.

This adventure is **optimized for a party of five 8th level characters**. To figure out whether you need to adjust the adventure, do the following:

- Add up the total levels of all the characters.
- Divide the total by the number of characters.
- Round fractions of .5 or greater up; round fractions of less than .5 down.

You’ve now determined the **average party level (APL)** for the adventure. To figure out the **party strength** for the adventure, consult the following table.

#### Determining Party Strength

|             | 3-4 characters | 5 characters | 6-7 characters |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| **APL < 8** | Very Weak      | Weak         | Average        |
| **APL = 8** | Weak           | Average      | Strong         |
| **APL > 8** | Average        | Strong       | Very Strong    |

Average party strength indicates no recommended adjustments to the adventure. Each sidebar may or may not offer suggestions for certain party strengths. If a particular recommendation isn’t offered for your grou

## Courtyard

Dead Githzerai guards and Slaad

Unlike other observation stations, this base has a protective ring wall with heavy gates, that now stand unlocked and open. In the courtyard are the bodies of 8 dead Githzerai guards and about 20 dead Red & Blue Slaad. The fighting ended quite awhile ago, and there are only a couple bored-looking Red Slaad wandering around, poking at the bodies.

The heavy blast doors to the facility itself are still closed and locked. Near the door is a keycard reader with a green circle.

Also in this area are a few outbuildings, including a large barracks with around 50 bunks, and a cafeteria with a fully stocked waffle bar that has been miraculously spared in the fighting.

Investigation of the cafeteria reveals the bodies of several human scientists, all killed by Slaad. Each of the scientists are carrying a green keycard.

In the middle of the courtyard is a folded up paper airplane containing the intern’s journal entry. On the back of the torn-out page, in frantic scribbles, is written “HELP US! TRAPPED ON LEVEL FOUR.”

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

Day One: New job! I’m so excited. As a Githzerai child with no interest or aptitude for psionics or the monastic lifestyle, I never fit in. I’ve always been interested in science and biology, but those aren’t things our culture places much value on.

My parents were confused by me, but supportive, and I was thrilled when my mother called on a contact from her days as a _rrakkma_ to get me an internship with the human scientists operating out of a research station here in Limbo. Their organization, Fresenius Research, was contracted to research the Slaad and find ways to combat the lethal infections they carry. I can’t believe I’m going to help them do science that will benefit everyone in Limbo!

## Facility Level 1: Code Green

Above the board slaad research

The first floor of this facility is an open-plan laboratory. The only exits are the main doors you just came through and another door on the opposite wall with another keycard reader, this one with a yellow circle.

This area is entirely devoted to scientific research on Slaads. There are diagrams of Slaad anatomy tacked to the walls, whiteboards covered with theories about how to interrupt the Slaad reproductive cycle, and all sorts of scientific equipment from microscopes to bunsen burners and sample jars. Along one wall are a series of cages, all large enough to hold a Slaad, all open and empty.

Scattered around the facility are the bodies of the scientists, in various states of dismemberment. Also here, easily surprised, are three Red Slaad and two Blue Slaad. They will fight until three Slaad have died, then the survivors will attempt to flee out the main door.

Investigation reveals one scientist is still alive. He is unconscious, but can be roused. However, he can only answer a couple questions before a chestburster scene happens and a Slaad Tadpole bursts from his chest, killing him. He is the floor supervisor, and in his pocket is a yellow keycard.

One of the tables has a folder with the intern’s name on it. Inside is a torn-out sheet from the intern’s journal.

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

Day 17: It’s only been three tendays, but I’m already so glad I came! I’m learning so much (and the waffle bar is delicious!).

There is a squad of Githzeria monks and an anarch here, who keep the research station floating in a bubble of stable space, unaffected by the surrounding chaos. They live in the barracks outside the main building. They are polite but distant.

The scientists here genuinely seem to like me. They do appear to find the idea of a Githzerai scientist unusual, but in a charming way, and seem to have largely adopted me as a sort of lab mascot. They delight in calling me over to show off what they’re doing, and tell me how our (our!) research into the Slaad lifecycle is going to save lives. While they can be a bit patronizing, they obviously mean well.

I even met the head researcher! He’s a charming man with an infectious laugh who came down from the fourth floor specifically to meet me. He asked me a lot of questions and then spoke to the floor director privately. Later, I was told that he’d taken a personal interest in me, and instructed the floor director to promote me to level two! I can’t believe it, but I start tomorrow!

## Facility Level 2: Code Yellow

Unethical research on unwilling human subjects that could be slaad

After ascending the stairs, you emerge onto the second floor of the facility. It is similar to the first floor, but it is clear the research on this level is being conducted on human test subjects. On the back wall is a door with an orange keycard rader. The floor is divided into two areas, one clearly focused on the effects of a Slaad egg on the human system, showing how the egg gestates and eventually hatches. The other half of the floor is looking into the Chaos Phage illness, charting its progression and the host’s inevitable conversion to a Slaad. There are notes on the conditions that lead to different color Slaad and what conditions might inhibit (or encourage) the progression.

Downstairs the cages had clearly been used to hold Slaad. But up here, each cage contains a gurney, with heavy-duty looking straps. Nearly every bed holds the body of a human wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. They’re all dead, with the tell-tale burst rib cages that mark the emergence of a Slaad Tadpole. On some of the gurneys, the straps have been broken, as if the prison became inhumanely strong.

As downstairs, there are the bodies of mauled scientists. Unlike downstairs, the bodies have been gathered in the back corner, near a makeshift nest containing six Slaad Tadpoles. The bodies are being fed to the tadpoles by adult Slaad.

Unlike downstairs, however, the Slaad on this floor appear younger, leaner, and are wearing the tattered remains of human clothes. Guarding the nest are two Red Slaad, wearing prison jumpsuits, and a Blue Slaad, wearing a lab coat. They will fight to the death to defend the nest. In the Blue Slaad’s lab coat there is an orange keycard.

Treasure: The research here can be collected and delivered to the Limbo Drakeguard medical team to advance their research. On one of the tables is another torn-out sheet of the journal.

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

Day 36: I’m experiencing some doubts about the research they’re doing here. On the first floor, it was all what I expected. Taking samples from captive Slaad and conducting research. But level two is different. There are no Slaad up here, only human prisoners. The scientists here are less friendly and more guarded about their research, but it isn’t hard to work out.

They’re deliberately infecting the prisoners with both chaos phage and Slaad eggs, harvested from level one. The prisoners are kept sedated, so they don’t seem to be suffering, and some of the research appears to be investigating how to control the speed of the infection or incubation process.

I tell myself they’re looking for ways to slow it down, but I have my doubts. I’ve shared my concerns with a few scientists, but they just brush it off by explaining that these prisoners are “the worst of the worst” from the material plane, where they all have death sentences.

Only one person understood my concerns. He called me over during lunch one day and told me to stop asking so many questions. I protested, pointing out that the work we’re doing seems unethical. He didn’t deny it, but only implied that objecting would get me in trouble. The next day he was gone. I’ve been keeping my head down, focusing on my research. The floor supervisor says the head researching is still asking about me, but I think I have to say something, even if it means they fire me.

</aside>

## Facility Level 3: Code Orange

Research on other scientists who objected, clear signs of mindflayers

The third floor of the facility is more dimly lit, mostly from table lamps at various work stations around the room. The keypad on the opposite door has a red circle. The science here is harder to interpret.

As below, the room is full of the bodies of dead scientists. However, on the lower floors, they had been torn apart, or chest-bursted by Slaad Tadpoles. The bodies on this floor show broken bones and clear evidence of blunt force trauma, as if they were toys thrown across the room by a child having a temper tantrum.

Kneeling over some of the bodies, having broken open their skulls and devouring their brains, are three former scientists wearing blood-splattered lab coats. These Slaad seem… wrong. They all share the same sickly purple hue to their skin. They have odd growths and protuberances that remind you of ocean creatures. Their pupils have elongated into horizontal bars that all now stare at you. It is clear their minds have been broken by their transformation, and snarling, they all now hurl themselves towards you.

The notes and charts you see seem to document the progression of a disease similar to Chaos Phage …perhaps derived from it? There is no discussion here of curing or delaying the effects of the disease, only notes on how it affects the subjects and their resulting transformation.

In the pocket of one of the bodies that’s had it’s brain eaten, you find a red keycard.

Below a table lamp in the corner of the room, you find another torn-out journal page.

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

Day 42: I had the strangest conversation with the level two supervisor. I sat him down after work one day and explained my concerns, told him that what we were doing was unethical and certainly not the type of science I expected to be doing here. But the man acted bizarrely. He responded as though I was enthusiastic and told me what good work I was doing, and that the head researcher had expressed an interest in putting me on “the rapid track” to level three.

Now I find myself here, in this dimly lit place. The science here is even more abstract. We’re still operating on prisoners, but whatever we’re testing on them is different. The details are jealously guarded, but I think it’s a modified version of Chaos Phage. I’m not sure how it’s been changed, but I can see from the observation records that it’s much faster acting. Who knows if that’s all they’ve done to it.

These people have no concern for the health of the subjects. The sedation is often insufficient, and I hear the prisoners moan and struggling against their straps. Whatever we’re doing here, it’s clear that it’s no longer about Slaad or saving lives. I can’t imagine the head researcher approves of this. I’m going to find a way to take my concerns directly to him.

</aside>

## Facility Level 4: Code Red

Full-on human to mindflayer experiments directly supervised by head researcher

This floor is smaller, about half the size of the lower floors. It is even more dimly lit than the third floor. On the far wall is a set of double doors, cracked out, a shaft of red light spilling out.

There are several cages against one wall, and only a single workstation. In one of the cages, with a barred window looking down on the courtyard, you find the intern’s journal, with one last entry.

The desk belongs to the head researcher. The notes are written in Undercommon. If anyone can read them or translate, they describe the culmination of a project to reverse engineer Chaos Phage to produce a disease that will forcibly convert a host into an Illithid. There are a series of ticks next to various completed tasks, with one remaining unchecked: Test on Githyanki subject.

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

Day 55. I’m in a cage. How could I have been so foolish? Of course the head researcher knew. I was fooled by his charming demeanor. But when I pulled him aside during one of his rare visits to level three and shared my concerns he just smiled and laughed that easy laugh of his. Then I blacked out and woke up here.

There are a few other imprisoned scientists in the other cells, including the researcher from level two who warned me to keep my head down. Now I know where he disappeared to, I guess. He tells me that every day the head researcher takes one of us into the operating theater. We never see them again, but the bodies that are wheeled past us aren’t Slaad. They’re purple and have horrible tentacled faces that I’ve only seen in my nightmares…

I’ve torn the first page from my journal and threw it out the window with a cry for help. Maybe one of the Githzerai guards will see it. I can’t believe they could be in on this depravity.

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

Day 61: I’m the last. They took my friend last night. No help is coming. I know my time is limited. Forgive me for my role in this.

## Operating theater

Head researcher is unveiled as mind flayer testing his mind flayer venom on a gith subject before he peaces out

Beyond the double doors you find an operating room. The lights glow a sickly red, and reveal a Githyanki youth strapped down to a table, looking terrified. Standing over him, injecting a fluid into an IV bag already connected to the kid’s arm, is a kindly-looking human scientist. There is a strong air of illusion magic around him.

He doesn’t move, but keeps his hand on the knob that will start the drip. He will try to smooth talk them, get them talking. The whole time, he’s using telekinesis to move needles full of the poison to inject into the players. If anyone succeeds on a DC 30 Wisdom (Perception) check, they’ll notice the needles. Otherwise, have the group make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being infected with Illithid Phage.

While infected, the target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every round. If the disease reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target passes out and must make death saving throws to avoid being transformed into a mind flayer.

If the players move to attack, the mind flayer will open the knob and flee out the back door (opens to a balcony) telling the players that they can either stop him or save the boy.
