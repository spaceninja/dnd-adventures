TK intro

## Engineering

- Controlled by Ops Union
- Exits:
  - Hatch to Life Support
  - Airlock
  - Elevator (guarded)
- Notable NPCs: Chief

The outer wall of this large space is dominated by two huge pieces of identical machinery with glowing panels, clearly labeled as “Reactor #1” and “Reactor #2”. In front of each is a collection of monitoring stations, staffed by frazzled-looking engineers. Despite your lack of knowledge, it seems like every meter and gauge you see is in the red. You get the sense that the whole system might come crashing down at any time.

There’s a small block of offices nearby, each crowded with clutter, spare parts, and printed diagrams that you can’t make sense of. Between the reactors, you can see an airlock hatch, while on the inner wall there’s a squad of guards standing at a checkpoint near the elevator door to prevent anyone who’s not part of Ops Union from entering.

As you observe, a female dwarf carrying a huge wrench, with braided red hair and beard and greasy coveralls stands in the center of the room and hollers to get everyone’s attention:

“Break’s over, people! I know you’re tired, but this whole place is going to shit. We’ve got a fire in the cargo tunnels, a coolant leak in the primary reactor, and we’re venting atmo in 3 places. Let’s get to work!”

### The Chief Engineer

- Female Dwarf
- Huge wrench, braided red hair and beard, greasy coveralls
- Demanding, respected, overworked
- Sounds like Pam from Archer
- Can be found in Engineering

“Break’s over, people! I know you’re tired, but this whole place is going to shit. We’ve got a fire in the cargo tunnels, a coolant leak in the primary reactor, and we’re venting atmo in 3 places. Let’s get to work!”

The Chief is well-regarded by her crew, and takes pride in the safety rating they maintained until combat started. Now her only concern is keeping the station intact. She finds the ethics of the situation incredibly boring, and certainly irrelevant when the station is trying to tear itself apart.

By maintaining a neutral position, her crew has (mostly) been able to access the parts of the ship they need in order to solve problems, but it’s been difficult, and she has the impression things are getting worse as the fighting intensifies and her crew gets more and more exhausted.

If asked for access to the Cargo Bay (or airlocks, or any other facility under Ops Union control), the Chief gives a brusque “No,” explaining those areas are under lockdown to protect the station. She says she’d grant access if the characters helped out with an urgent problem. If they agree, she refers them to the Technician.

#### Quest: Destroy the Portal

If the characters success at fixing the coolant leak in the reactor, the Chief will call them back to make them an offer. As she sees it, the cause of all this trouble is the Portal itself. She asks you to find a way into the Portal Chamber, to physically destroy the portal itself, and destroy the portal plans, which are stored on a secure drive in the chamber.

If the group can pull this off, she says she can smuggle them off-station to escape to the planet. They wouldn’t be able to return to their time, but they’d have stopped all the abuse of the timeline.

Reward: Escape to the planet

## Life Support

- Controlled by Ops Union
- Exits:
  - Hatch to Engineering
  - Cargo Tunnel (guarded)
  - Elevator (barricaded)
- Notable NPCs: Technician

This enormous space is filled with oversized machinery, all connected by pipes of various sizes. Some are painted and labeled, some have spinning fans, and others are clear and full of water, including the one that the Technician is swimming in. At various points in the room are computer terminals displaying monitoring displays that don’t mean much to an untrained observer.

There are a handful of offices tucked into spare corners. These all look like auto mechanic shop offices, with half-height walls and wrap-around windows granting a clear view of the surrounding area. Each has been taken over as a relatively private sleeping area by exhausted Ops Union personnel, who are sleeping in office chairs or under desks.

On one side of the room is a large hatch labeled “Engineering,” which is unguarded. In the middle of the inner wall are two further exits. The door to the elevator has been completely blocked by a stack of large cargo containers. Through the hatch to the Cargo Tunnel you can see a barricade constructed to stop anyone from coming down the Tunnel to Life Support, or past it to the Cargo Bay.

### The Technician

- Merman
- Green-blue skin, webbed fingers, large eyes
- Worried, fearful
- Sounds like a dolphin (Station AI translates)
- Can be found in Life Support

“Oh, this is bad, this is really bad. If I reroute flow through the tertiary system… shit, that only gives us 30 hours. What am I going to do?”

The Technician is a fluid mechanics specialist who lives in the water tanks and pipes on the Life Support deck. He knows there is a leak in the coolant system for the reactors, but can’t locate or fix it, and the clock is ticking.

#### Quest: Keep the Station from Exploding

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. There’s a coolant leak on the main reactor. It’s going to go critical and destroy the entire station in 30 hours. The only way to fix it is to put on vacsuits and access the Station Exterior.

If you agree to help, the Ops Union will give vacsuits to everyone on the team, granting you access to the airlocks (and a way around station security).

Reward: Airlock access
