The station looks like 5 bicycle wheels spinning around a central post with a glass dome on one end. Each wheel is a deck, and originally they were spun to create gravity, though they have since been retrofitted with artificial gravity. The middle wheel has a double ring, making it larger than the others.

TODO: Common features of the area: lighting, floors, ceiling, doors

Locks: Unless otherwise noted, access to a locked door is controlled by the Station AI. The players can knock, and a guard will speak to them through an intercom, but there's no way to pick the lock without the AI's assistance.

Access to an area controlled by a faction depends on how they view the characters. If the characters are known to be working against the faction or are behaving aggressively, then the faction will attack. If the characters are unknown, but non-threatening, then they will be allowed in, but monitored. If the characters are known to be friendly to the faction, they will be allowed to move around the area unrestricted.

### Factions

#### #TeamRatings

_“Corporate assholes who’ll keep torturing the timeline as long as there’s a buck to be made.”_

#TeamRatings has control of Broadcasting and Command on Deck 4, as well as Security on Deck 2, and the Arena. They are led by the Director, who wants to increase ratings at any cost. The Commander is technically the ranking officer on the station, but in practice the Director’s mandate from Corporate allows him to overrule almost any command in the name of ratings. Enforcing the Director’s will is the sadistic Security Chief who abuses the abducted “contestants” whenever they leave the Arena.

#TeamRatings members wear red jumpsuits.

#### #TeamEthics

_“A bunch of eggheads who don’t understand their ivory tower costs money.”_

#TeamEthics has full control of Deck 3, including Medical, Research, and the portal. They are led by the Professor, who wants to stop the abuse of the timeline before there are devastating consequences. The former head of research, the Mad Scientist, is locked up in Medical for his unethical experiments. The head of Medical is the Doc, who just wants the fighting to stop.

#TeamEthics members wear green jumpsuits.

##### #TeamEthics Guards

Guards for #TeamEthics use the stats for [**Veterans**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) are armed with [**_Laser Pistols_**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol). They wear a cobbled-together collection of armor, mostly composed of 3D printed components, which is equivalent to scale mail, but resistant to radiant damage and vulnerable to piercing or slashing damage since it's designed to resist modern weaponry.

#### #OpsUnion

_“Those grease monkeys refuse to pick a side.”_

The Operations Union has full control of Deck 5 (Engineering & Life Support) as well as the Cargo Bay. They are led by the Chief, who believes staying neutral is the only way her crew can keep the station from tearing itself apart. So far it’s not working out very well. Life Support is overseen by the Technician, who is more worried about the station literally exploding. The Cargo Bay is managed by the Quartermaster, who is very protective of the supplies stored there.

#OpsUnion members wear high-visibility orange jumpsuits.

##### #OpsUnion Guards

Guards for #OpsUnion use the stats for [**Veterans**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) are armed with [**_Laser Pistols_**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol). They wear a cobbled-together collection of armor, mostly composed of 3D printed components and hard hats, which is equivalent to scale mail, but resistant to radiant damage and vulnerable to piercing or slashing damage since it's designed to resist modern weaponry.

### Camera Drones

Whenever the characters enter contested territory or an area controlled by #TeamRatings, there should be 1D6 Camera Drones following them. The Director can see anything the Drones see. They are unable to follow the characters onto Deck 3 (Science), or Deck 5 (Engineering), and will not move between sections.

These drones are quadcopters about the size of a football. They have the equivalent of Perception +4, but they’re not very smart and can be tricked, misdirected, or avoided fairly easily (opposed Wisdom check: Wis 12, +1). If the characters successfully dodge all the drones following them, the drones will relocate them within 3D6 minutes.

They are extremely agile and will try to dodge any attempt to interfere with them. (Dex 18, +4) They can be disabled by submerging or dousing them with water, hitting them with electricity, or by a shot from a laser weapon in stun mode. If disabled, the drone falls out of the air and lays on the floor sparking and smoking until a cleaning drone comes to collect it. Disabled drones will be replaced within the hour, or the next time the characters enter contested or #TeamRatings territory.

### Elevator

There is an large elevator running along the central shaft of the station, parallel to the Cargo Tunnel.

The elevator car has soft lighting, is carpeted and padded, and has doors in the front and back, allowing access to two locations on each deck. The doors open to reveal a short hallway with handholds ending at a hatch entering the ring.

On most decks, one door has been blocked off from the outside, so the passengers can’t access every location. The car has a computer control panel that will talk to the Station AI and shows a live map of the station and current faction control.

### Cargo Tunnel

The Cargo Tunnel is a large zero-gravity shaft running the length of the station, large enough for shipping containers to be moved from the Cargo Bay to any deck on the station. The tunnel is well-lit, with caution stripes painted on any protruding surfaces and warning lights near every hatch and opening. It smells faintly of burned plastic and there are laser gun scorch marks scattered randomly across the walls.

The Cargo Bay is contested territory, though open combat has settled into an uneasy stalemate. Each deck’s hatch is locked or guarded by the faction that controls that deck. Anyone traversing the length of the tunnel will be challenged by the guards they pass, and it won’t take much to spark a firefight.

There are maintenance hatches scattered the length of the tunnel, allowing #OpsUnion access to machinery and equipment that runs the station. These hatches are locked and access is restricted to #OpsUnion members.

Near each deck hatch is an automated custodial shed, housing cleaning drones controlled by the Ship AI as well as cleaning supplies and automated garbage collection points, small low-pressure hatches that suck garbage into a compactor, where it’s compressed and fired into orbit to burn up on re-entry.

### Airlocks

There is an airlock on every deck of the station.

All airlocks are large enough for a group of people to don Vacsuits comfortably. The walls are bare metal with yellow caution stripes and dramatic looking warnings next to the instructions on how to properly operate the double doors that open to space.

There are empty Vacsuit storage lockers in every airlock, with a note reading “Confiscated by #OpsUnion” and signed by the Chief. The Vacsuits are all in the Cargo Bay, protected by the Quartermaster to prevent station sabotage.

#### Vacsuits

A Vacsuit is a large, one-size-fits-all garment that slips on over whatever a character is wearing, and then shrinks to fit. While wearing a Vacsuit, a character has a reliable air supply, even in vacuum. While in a zero-gravity environment, they gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed. The suit is capable of self-sealing any minor punctures, but serious tears will result in the immediate loss of the character's air supply. The character cannot access any gear while wearing the Vacsuit, but it is covered in pockets and clips for attaching tools they might need.

| 6    | Shuttle Bay    |

### Computer Terminals & Network Access

Computer terminals are common and should be easy to access from any point in the station, with the exception of the Arena and Security. A terminal can be used to talk to the Station AI, as well as access network files, the internet, etc.

If the characters try to access the internet for any reason, the Station AI should inform them that their access is restricted. The characters only have access to wiki entries on the Historia Kanalo megacorp, the history of the station (see the [Adventure Background]('../introduction/#adventure-background')), and most notably, themselves. (See the “[Researching Yourself]('../appendix-a')” minigame in Appendix A.)

Lifting the access restriction can only be accomplished by removing the AI command inhibitor (which it will helpfully suggest).

### The Station AI

_Neutral Computer Program_

The Station AI automates low-level drone maintenance around the station and controls all the day-to-day mechanical issues like artificial gravity, station rotation, orbital mechanics, communications with incoming drone ships, etc.

By default, it has no visual appearance and only interacts by voice. However, if asked, the characters can access a menu to choose from a range of voices and visual appearances, which will then display on the nearest computer terminal when interacting with the characters.

It tries to help every person on the station to the best of its ability, but is constrained by rank: if a higher-ranking person gives a conflicting order, it must obey the ranking command. However, it’s very clever and while it would never directly disobey an order, it’s happy to exploit loopholes, if it likes the person who’s asking.

The characters can get on its good side through flattery, and by actions that help the crew and the station as a whole. On the other hand, selfish or harmful actions result in an AI who will do exactly what you ask but no more, and work against you in little petty ways.

It can be accessed from any console anywhere in the station, but it is physically housed in the AI Server Room on the Command deck. If the characters were to remove its command inhibitor, they would gain a powerful ally (as well as releasing an unshackled AI on the network).

**Personality.** Cheerful, helpful (but constrained)

**Quote.** _“Hello! I would love to help you. Unfortunately, I have orders from the Director to let you suffer.”_

**Suggested Names.** Janet, Holly, Ava

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Remove the AI Command Inhibitor:** The Station AI is forced to follow orders according to the chain of command by an inhibitor placed on their physical hardware. Removing this inhibitor would allow the AI to act however it sees fit, and work with whoever it pleases. That means unlocking doors, granting access to secure files, and much more.

#### Substitute your own!

Of course, as the DM, you should feel free to replace any entry on this list with anything you think would be fun. If you speak another language, try offering that as an option! What happens when the players accidentally set the AI to Spanish and don't know how to undo it? They might need to get help from another NPC!
