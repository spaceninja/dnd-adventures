After escaping from the arena, the characters explore the rest of the space station. They learn that the crew is actively mutinying

## The Station

The station looks like 5 bicycle wheels spinning around a central post with a glass dome on one end. Each wheel is a deck, and originally they were spun to create gravity, though they have since been retrofitted with artificial gravity. The middle wheel has a double ring, making it larger than the others.

Access to an area controlled by a faction depends on how they view the characters. If the characters are known to be working against the faction or are behaving aggressively, then the faction will attack. If the characters are unknown, but non-threatening, then they will be allowed in, but monitored. If the characters are known to be friendly to the faction, they will be allowed to move around the area unrestricted.

### Factions

#### #TeamRatings

“Corporate assholes who’ll keep torturing the timeline as long as there’s a buck to be made.”

#TeamRatings has control of Broadcasting and Command on Deck 4, as well as Security on Deck 2, and the Arena. They are led by the Director, who wants to increase ratings at any cost. The Commander is technically the ranking officer on the station, but in practice the Director’s mandate from Corporate allows him to overrule almost any command in the name of ratings. Enforcing the Director’s will is the sadistic Security Chief who abuses the abducted “contestants” whenever they leave the Arena.

#TeamRatings members wear red jumpsuits.

#### #TeamEthics

“A bunch of scientists who don’t understand their ivory tower costs money.”

#TeamEthics has full control of Deck 3, including Medical, Research, and the portal. They are led by the Professor, who wants to stop the abuse of the timeline before there are devastating consequences. The former head of research, the Mad Scientist, is locked up in Medical for his unethical experiments. The head of Medical is the Doctor, who just wants the fighting to stop.

#TeamEthics members wear green jumpsuits.

##### #TeamEthics Guards

Guards for #TeamEthics use the stats for [Veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) are armed with [Laser Pistols](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol). They wear a cobbled-together collection of armor, mostly composed of 3D printed components.

#### Ops Union

“Those grease monkeys refuse to pick a side.”

Ops Union has full control of Deck 5 (Engineering & Life Support) as well as the Cargo Bay. They are led by the Chief, who believes staying neutral is the only way her crew can keep the station from tearing itself apart. So far it’s not working out very well. Life Support is overseen by the Technician, who is more worried about the station literally exploding. The Cargo Bay is managed by the Quartermaster, who is very protective of the supplies stored there.

Ops Union members wear high-visibility orange jumpsuits.

### Camera Drones

Whenever the characters enter contested territory or an area controlled by #TeamRatings, there should be 1D6 Camera Drones following them. The Director can see anything the Drones see. They are unable to follow the characters onto Deck 3 (Science), or Deck 5 (Engineering), and will not move between sections.

These drones are quadcopters about the size of a football. They have the equivalent of Perception +4, but they’re not very smart and can be tricked, misdirected, or avoided fairly easily (opposed Wisdom check: Wis 12, +1). If the characters successfully dodge all the drones following them, the drones will relocate them within 3D6 minutes.

They are extremely agile and will try to dodge any attempt to interfere with them. (Dex 18, +4) They can be disabled by submerging or dousing them with water, hitting them with electricity, or by a shot from a laser weapon in stun mode. If disabled, the drone falls out of the air and lays on the floor sparking and smoking until a cleaning drone comes to collect it. Disabled drones will be replaced within the hour, or the next time the characters enter contested or #TeamRatings territory.

### Elevator

There is an large elevator running along the central shaft of the station, parallel to the Cargo Tunnel.

The elevator car has soft lighting, is carpeted and padded, and has doors in the front and back, allowing access to two locations on each deck. The doors open to reveal a short hallway with handholds ending at a hatch entering the ring.

On most decks, one door has been blocked off from the outside, so the passengers can’t access every location. The car has a computer control panel that will talk to the Station AI and shows a live map of the station and current faction control.

#### Elevator Exits

| Deck | Destination               |
| ---- | :------------------------ |
| 1    | Arena (locked)            |
| 2    | Security (locked)         |
| 2    | Crew Quarters             |
| 3    | Research (barricaded)     |
| 3    | Medical (guarded)         |
| 4    | Lobby                     |
| 5    | Engineering (guarded)     |
| 5    | Life Support (barricaded) |
| 6    | Shuttle Bay               |
| 6    | Cargo Bay (barricaded)    |

### Cargo Tunnel

The Cargo Tunnel is a large zero-gravity shaft running the length of the station, large enough for shipping containers to be moved from the Cargo Bay to any deck on the station. The tunnel is well-lit, with caution stripes painted on any protruding surfaces and warning lights near every hatch and opening. It smells faintly of burned plastic and there are laser gun scorch marks scattered randomly across the walls.

The Cargo Bay is contested territory, though open combat has settled into an uneasy stalemate. Each deck’s hatch is locked or barricaded and guarded by the faction that controls that deck. Anyone traversing the length of the tunnel will be challenged by the guards they pass, and it won’t take much to spark a firefight.

There are maintenance hatches scattered the length of the tunnel, allowing Ops Union access to machinery and equipment that runs the station. These hatches are locked and access is restricted to Ops Union members.

Near each deck hatch is an automated custodial shed, housing cleaning drones controlled by the Ship AI as well as cleaning supplies and automated garbage collection points, small low-pressure hatches that suck garbage into a compactor, where it’s compressed and fired into orbit to burn up on re-entry.

#### Cargo Tunnel Exits

| Deck | Entrance               |
| ---- | :--------------------- |
| 1    | Arena (locked)         |
| 2    | Security (guarded)     |
| 3    | Research (guarded)     |
| 4    | Command (locked)       |
| 5    | Life Support (guarded) |
| 6    | Cargo Bay              |

### Airlocks

There is an airlock on every deck of the station.

All airlocks are large enough for a group of people to don vacsuits comfortably. The walls are bare metal with yellow caution stripes and dramatic looking warnings next to the instructions on how to properly operate the double doors that open to space.

There are empty vacsuit storage lockers in every airlock, with a note reading “Confiscated by Ops Union” and signed by the Chief. The vacsuits are all in the Cargo Bay, protected by the Quartermaster to prevent station sabotage.

#### Airlocks

| Deck | Entrance       |
| ---- | :------------- |
| 1    | Arena (sealed) |
| 2    | Crew Quarters  |
| 3    | Medical        |
| 4    | Broadcasting   |
| 5    | Engineering    |
| 6    | Shuttle Bay    |

### Computer Terminals & Network Access

Computer terminals are common and should be easy to access from any point in the station, with the exception of the Arena and Security. A terminal can be used to talk to the Station AI, as well as access network files, the internet, etc.

If the characters try to access the internet for any reason, the Station AI should inform them that their access is restricted. The characters can only access some very basic wiki articles about the future, the Historia Kanalo megacorp, and most notably, themselves. (See the “[Researching Yourself]('../appendix-a')” minigame in Appendix A.)

Lifting the access restriction can only be accomplished by removing the AI command inhibitor (which it will helpfully suggest).

### The Station AI

- Computer Program, presents as female
- Cheerful, helpful (but constrained)
- Sounds like Janet from the Good Place
- Can be accessed from any console
- Physically housed in Command

“Hello! I would love to help you. Unfortunately, I have orders from the Director to let you suffer.”

The Station AI automates low-level drone maintenance around the station and controls all the day-to-day mechanical issues like artificial gravity, station rotation, orbital mechanics, communications with incoming drone ships, etc.

It tries to help every person on the station to the best of its ability, but is constrained by rank: if a higher-ranking person gives a conflicting order, it must obey the ranking command. However, it’s very clever and while it would never directly disobey an order, it’s happy to exploit loopholes, if it likes the person who’s asking.

The characters can get on its good side through flattery, and by actions that help the crew and the station as a whole. On the other hand, selfish or harmful actions result in an AI who will do exactly what you ask but no more, and work against you in little petty ways.

It can be accessed from any console anywhere in the station (and they’re everywhere), but it is physically housed on the Command deck. If the characters were to remove its command inhibitor, they would gain a powerful ally (as well as releasing an unshackled AI on the network)

#### Quest: Remove the AI Command Inhibitor

The Station AI is forced to follow orders according to the chain of command by an inhibitor placed on their physical hardware. Removing this inhibitor would allow the AI to act however it sees fit, and work with whoever it pleases. That means unlocking doors, granting access to secure files, and much more.

Reward: AI support, unlocked doors & anything AI controls
