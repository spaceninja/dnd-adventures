## Habitation

_Contested territory_

- Exits:
  - Hatch to Security (guarded)
  - Elevator
  - Airlock

TODO features of the area: light, ceiling, floors, walls, doors, sounds, smells

### Gym

> TODO: read-aloud description

The gym is empty, with a sign on the door reading “Closed for maintenance.” There’s a weight room and a swimming pool, as well as a large locker room and sauna.

#### Secret Hatch

There is a secret hatch behind a ventilation cover on the ceiling. It has been hidden brilliantly, and the characters have no chance of finding it on their own. They will only be able to locate it if they are told of its existence by the Strategist. Once opened, it reveals a tight crawlspace that leads to the Brig.

### Corridor

> Upon entering the Crew Quarters your first impression is simmering tension. Everywhere you walk, you feel suspicious eyes on you. Some of the doorways have been barricaded. Members of the crew move around in small groups, not lingering any longer than needed. Opposing factions, recognizable from the color of their jumpsuits, stare each other down, silently daring the others to start something. It feels like one spark could cause this place to erupt into open combat. Consulting a map on the wall, you can see that in addition to dozens of officer’s cabins and crew sleeping pods, there’s a large cafeteria, a gym, and a bar. Across from the bar is the Elevator, and there’s an airlock near the gym. One corridor ends in a hatch labeled “Security,” with several armed guards stationed nearby.

### Crew Cabins

Inaccessible to the players

### Bar

> As you approach the bar, you see someone get thrown out. Two brawly bouncers physically hurl a crew member in a red uniform across the hall, where he slams into the wall and hits the ground with a thud. He stands up and starts to protest, explaining that he didn’t mean anything by it, but the bouncers just glare at him until he leaves. When you approach, the bouncers look you up and down, but allow you to pass unchallenged.
>
> The attitude changes completely when you enter the bar. The room is full of crew members from every faction, drinking and laughing and relaxing together. You see a couple making out in a booth, wearing uniforms from opposing factions. The lights in the space have been dimmed, with most of the light coming from neon signs on the wall. Behind the bar is a large hand-written sign with the rules:
>
> There is a smaller sign attached to the larger one, which reads “Help Wanted”
>
> Standing below the sign, polishing a glass is the bartender, a handsome human man with twinkling eyes, dark skin, and a silk shirt. He sees you looking around and smiles and gestures for you to approach the bar.

_Neutral Good Human Rogue_

- Twinkling eyes, dark skin, silk shirt
- Flirtatious, bargaining
- Sounds like Lando Calrissian
- Can be found in Crew Quarters

The Bartender runs a bar in the contested territory of the Crew Quarters. There is often open combat just outside, but everyone has agreed to treat the bar as neutral ground.

As a result, the Bartender has become a political liaison, gossipmonger, mediator, and go-between. Everyone implicitly understands the value of this role, so no one abuses it (and if anyone tries, the other patrons generally sort it out quickly by removing the offender and making it clear they’re not welcome any longer).

The Bartender also runs a splendid little black market. With the cargo tunnels blockaded and free movement restricted, all sides can bring items to the bar to barter with, ensuring that the Bartender is the person most likely to have whatever you want, whether it’s supplies, clean uniforms, weapons, or drugs.

The Bartender uses the stats for a [**Swashbuckler**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17340-swashbuckler).

**Personality.** TK, TK, TK.

**Quote.** _“Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to my bar! What can I get you lovelies?”_

**Suggested Names.** Kentucky Bourbon, Arturo Fuente, Cristobal Baccarat

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Get Supplies from Cargo Bay:** The Bartender is running low on booze. He needs some crates picked up from the Quartermaster. He’s already arranged it with the #OpsUnion, but the open fighting between the bar and the cargo bay has made it impossible to retrieve the supplies.

If you bring back the supplies, the Bartender will grant you access to his “special” inventory, including some modern weaponry that will help even the odds. He offers one [**_Laser Pistol_**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol) (stuck on “stun”) now, and the chance to buy more later.
