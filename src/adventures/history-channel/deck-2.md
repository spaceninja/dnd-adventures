Deck 2 is split into two sections: Security and Habitation. Security (described in [Part 2](../part-2/#security)) is controlled by #TeamRatings, and used to control the gladiator contests in the Arena. Habitation consists of crew facilities such as the gym and officer's quarters. This area is contested, with the exception of the Bar, which is neutral territory.

## Habitation

_Contested territory_

### Gym

> The secret corridor from the Brig drops you into an empty changing room. Rows of lockers, benches, and showers sit unused. Stepping into the main space of the Gym you see a wide array of exercise equipment, but no people. At the exit to the corridor, you find a sign reading "Closed for maintenance."

If the characters search the lockers they find little of interest beyond a pile of clean towels, some sweat-stained workout clothes, and a single crew [**_Jumpsuit_**](../appendix-magic-items/#uniform) in #OpsUnion orange.

#### Secret Hatch

There is a secret hatch behind a ventilation cover on the ceiling of the locker room. It has been hidden brilliantly, and the characters have no chance of finding it on their own. They will only be able to locate it if they are told of its existence by the Strategist. Once opened, it reveals a tight crawlspace that leads to the Brig.

### Corridor

> Upon entering the Crew Quarters your first impression is simmering tension. Everywhere you walk, you feel suspicious eyes on you. Some of the doorways have been barricaded. Members of the crew move around in small groups, not lingering any longer than needed. Opposing factions, recognizable from the color of their jumpsuits, stare each other down, silently daring the others to start something. It feels like one spark could cause this place to erupt into open combat.

The long semicircular corridor has dozens of locked doors to officer's cabins and crew sleeping pods. At one end is a locked doorway to Security. There are no guards visible, but there is a camera above the door, and if the characters linger near the Security door, a squad of guards will come out to capture them.

Midway along the corridor is an [Airlock](../part-3/#airlocks). The inner door is unlocked, but the [**_Vacsuit_**](../appendix-magic-items/#vacsuit) storage lockers are empty, with a note that the suits have been confiscated by #OpsUnion.

The [Elevator](../part-3/#elevator) is also unlocked, and the characters can use it to travel to other decks.

### Crew Cabins

Every crew cabin is locked and inaccessible to the players. Some are clearly occupied, as the characters can hear voices inside. Knocking or ringing the bell gets no answer.

If the characters somehow force access, they find unremarkable housing units with no valuables beyond crew [**_Jumpsuits_**](../appendix-magic-items/#uniform). Any crew members inside flee immediately.

<aside class="text--rules-sidebar">

#### The Bar is a good first stop

Once the characters escape the arena, do your best to steer them toward [the Bar](../deck-2/#bar), where [the Bartender](../deck-2/#the-bartender) can offer them a job to retrieve supplies from the Cargo Bay, which will get them moving through the station.

</aside>

### Bar

> As you near the bar, you see two brawly bouncers physically hurl a crew member in a red uniform across the hall, where he slams into the wall and hits the ground with a thud. He stands up and starts to protest, explaining that he didn’t mean anything by it, but the bouncers just glare at him until he leaves. When you approach, the bouncers look you up and down, but allow you to pass unchallenged.
>
> The attitude changes completely when you enter the bar. The room is full of crew members from every faction, drinking and laughing and relaxing together. Lo-fi music plays from a jukebox in the corner. You see a couple making out in a booth, wearing uniforms from opposing factions. Most of the light comes from neon signs on the wall. A large hand-written poster with the rules is hung near the bar, and a smaller sign reading “Help Wanted” is taped below that.
>
> Standing behind the bar, polishing a glass, is the bartender, a handsome human man with twinkling eyes, dark skin, and a silk shirt. He sees you enter and smiles, gesturing for you to come closer.

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Bar Rules**

1. This is Neutral Ground
1. No Fighting
1. No Politics
1. Barter Only: No credit! No company scrip! Information & Supplies wanted.

</aside>

The Bar is a large space with booths around three walls, tables in the center, and a long bartop with stools along the back wall. There's a jukebox, restrooms, and about 15-20 people at any given time. The door is guarded by two Bouncers, who use the stats for [**Gladiators**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gladiator).

If the characters cause any trouble, the Bartender will gesture at the Bouncers, who will attempt to throw the characters out of the Bar, and they will not be welcome back. If the characters fight the bouncers, the patrons will quickly flee, and the Bartender will produce a [**_Laser Rifle_**](../appendix-magic-items/#laser-weapon) from below the bar and start shooting.

### The Bartender

_Neutral Good Human Rogue_

There may be open combat just outside, but the Bartender strictly enforces the Bar as neutral territory. As a result, he has become a political liaison, gossipmonger, mediator, and go-between. Everyone implicitly understands the value of this role, so no one abuses it (and if anyone tries, the other patrons generally sort it out quickly by removing the offender and making it clear they’re not welcome any longer).

The Bartender also runs a splendid little black market. With the cargo tunnels blockaded and free movement restricted, all factions can bring items to the bar to barter with, ensuring that he is the person most likely to have whatever you want, whether it’s supplies, clean uniforms, weapons, or drugs.

The Bartender uses the stats for a [**Swashbuckler**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17340-swashbuckler).

**Personality.** Charming, flirtatious, bargaining

**Quote.** _“Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to my bar! What can I get you lovelies?”_

**Suggested Names.** Kentucky Bourbon, Arturo Fuente, Cristobal Baccarat

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Get Supplies from Cargo Bay:** The Bartender is running low on booze. He needs some crates picked up from the Quartermaster. He’s already arranged it with the #OpsUnion, but the open fighting between the bar and the cargo bay has made it impossible to retrieve the supplies.

If you bring back the supplies, the Bartender will grant you access to his “special” inventory, including modern weaponry. He offers one [**_Laser Pistol_**](../appendix-magic-items/#laser-weapon) (stuck on stun, deals nonlethal damage only) now, and the chance to buy more when you bring back the supplies.

</aside>

### Back Room

The Bar has a back room, mostly filled with crates of bottles, bar supplies, and assorted items the Bartender has taken in trade. There are weapons, armor, medical supplies, any much more. If the Bartender agrees to trade with the characters, he will bring them back here.

If the players have completed the job, he allows each character to choose one item from the table for free. Anything else would require bartering, because the Bartender will not accept any form of currency. He will trade for useful items such as Vac Suits, medical supplies, and modern weaponry.

<aside class="text--rules-sidebar">

#### Modern Weaponry

Giving the players access to modern weaponry and gear can help them feel more powerful. On the other hand, it may cause problems if the characters return to the past with modern gear. You could find an excuse to remove modern gear before they return home, or let them take it, but with a limited number of charges, and no way to reload.
