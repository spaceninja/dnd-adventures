### [**_Faction Armor_**](#faction-armor)

_Armor, uncommon_

The different factions wear different types of Armor. [**Security Guards**](../appendix-npcs/#security-guard) wear Security Armor, which is high quality anti-riot gear. The other factions wear Improvised Armor, which is cobbled together from found items and 3D printed parts.

| Name                   | Type   | AC                        | Strength | Stealth | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| **_Improvised Armor_** | Medium | 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) | --       | --      | 8 lb.  |
| **_Security Armor_**   | Medium | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | --       | --      | 10 lb. |

**_Improvised Armor._** This armor has been hastily cobbled together from common station items and 3D printed components.

**_Security Armor._** This armor is made from a reflective black material designed to protect against laser weapons, and includes a helmet with an anonymizing face mask. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to radiant damage and advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks.

### [**_Healing Pack_**](#healing-pack)

_Adventuring Gear, uncommon_

You regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you use the hypodermic injector in this pack.

### [**_Laser Weapon_**](#laser-weapon)

_Weapon (firearm), uncommon_

It’s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn’t have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the training rules in the Player’s Handbook to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.

| Name                                                                   | Type            | Damage      | Weight | Properties                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**_Laser Pistol_**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol) | Firearms Ranged | 3d6 radiant | 2 lb.  | Ammunition (Firearms), (Range 40/120), reload (50 shots)              |
| [**_Laser Rifle_**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-rifle)   | Firearms Ranged | 3d8 radiant | 7 lb.  | Ammunition (Firearms), (Range 100/300), reload (30 shots), two-handed |

Laser weapons can be set to "stun" mode, which will deal nonlethal damage.

A laser weapon comes with a single fully-charged energy cell.

Note that laser weapons carried by [**Security Guards**](../appendix-npcs/#security-guard) are biometrically locked, and will deliver a nasty shock to anyone else who tries to use them.

### [**_Longsword, +2_**](#longsword%2C-%2B2)

_Weapon (longsword), rare_

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Proficiency with a longsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

### [**_Mechanical Exoskeleton_**](#mechanical-exoskeleton)

_Wonderous Item, very rare_

The mechanical exoskeleton is a one-size-fits all framework of yellow metal pipes and cables that fits over a character's armor. The arms end in oversized manipulator claws suitable for moving large objects. Entering or exiting the exoskeleton takes an action.

While wearing the exoskeleton, you gain the following benefits:

- You have a +1 bonus to AC.
- Your Strength score is 23.
- You have advantage on Strength checks.
- Your speed is reduced by 5 feet.
- You have disadvantage on Dexterity and Stealth checks.

The exoskeleton can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 12 charges. Each charge provides 1 hour of operation. When the energy cell is drained or removed, the exoskeleton is inoperable. The user can still enter and exit as normal, but the exoskeleton remains frozen in place.

When not in use, the exoskeleton can be collapsed into a compact package about 3 feet by 2 foot by 6 inches, with a carrying handle, weighing 20 pounds. Expanding or collapsing the exoskeleton takes an action, and can only be done when it is not being worn.

### [**_Pulse Grenade_**](#pulse-grenade)

_Weapon (grenade), uncommon_

As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away.

Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding pulse grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### [**_Uniform_**](#uniform)

_Adventuring Gear, common_

The crew of the station wear jumpsuits in the proper color scheme for their faction (Red for #TeamRatings, Green for #TeamEthics, and high-visibility orange for #OpsUnion). Wearing a uniform does not count as a disguise by itself, but it could help a character blend in with other crew.

### [**_Vacsuit_**](#vacsuit)

_Adventuring gear, rare_

A Vacsuit (short for vacuum suit) is designed to allow a crew member to operate outside the station.

While wearing a Vacsuit, a character gains a self-contained air supply for one hour. While in a zero-gravity environment, they gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed. It also allows the wearer to speak to anyone else wearing a Vacsuit within line of sight.

The suit is a large, one-size-fits-all garment that slips on over whatever a character is wearing, and then shrinks to fit. The character cannot access any gear inside the Vacsuit, but it is covered in pockets and clips for attaching tools they might need. It is capable of self-sealing any minor punctures, but serious tears will result in the immediate loss of the character's air supply.
