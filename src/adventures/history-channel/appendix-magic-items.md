#### Vacsuits

A Vacsuit is a large, one-size-fits-all garment that slips on over whatever a character is wearing, and then shrinks to fit. While wearing a Vacsuit, a character has a reliable air supply, even in vacuum. While in a zero-gravity environment, they gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed. The suit is capable of self-sealing any minor punctures, but serious tears will result in the immediate loss of the character's air supply. The character cannot access any gear while wearing the Vacsuit, but it is covered in pockets and clips for attaching tools they might need.
