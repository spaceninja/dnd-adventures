### Mechanical Exoskeleton

The mechanical exoskeleton is a one-size-fits all framework of yellow metal pipes and cables that fits over a character's armor. While a character is wearing it, their AC is increased by 1, their Strength score becomes 23, they gain advantage on any strength checks, their speed is reduced by 5 feet, and they gain disadvantage on any dexterity or stealth checks. The character can either use their hands as normal, or control the oversized mechanical grabbers.

The exoskeleton comes with a single [energy cell](TODO). A single charge provides an hour of operation. When not in use, the exoskeleton can be collapsed into a compact package about 3 feet by 2 foot by 6 inches, with a carrying handle. Expanding or collapsing the exoskeleton takes an action, and can only be done when it is not being worn. Entering or exiting the exoskeleton also takes an action.

TODO: detail attacks with mechanical grabbers

#### Vacsuits

A Vacsuit is a large, one-size-fits-all garment that slips on over whatever a character is wearing, and then shrinks to fit. While wearing a Vacsuit, a character has a reliable air supply, even in vacuum. While in a zero-gravity environment, they gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed. The suit is capable of self-sealing any minor punctures, but serious tears will result in the immediate loss of the character's air supply. The character cannot access any gear while wearing the Vacsuit, but it is covered in pockets and clips for attaching tools they might need.
