## Outer Ring Promenade

_Contested Territory_

> You can tell this is (or rather, was) the nicest part of the station. The carpeting on the floor extends up the walls, and the lighting panels recessed in the ceiling glow warmly. Windows along the outer hull reveal excellent views of the planet rotating past. The hallway from the elevator leads invitingly to the food court, with a promenade wrapping away in either direction filled with shops for visiting tourists.
>
> The effect is rather ruined by the fact that the food courts are an active combat zone. The shops are all closed, their neon signs turned off and roll-down gates locked.

- Shopping, food court, souvenirs
- Exits:
  - Hatch to Broadcasting (locked)
  - Hatch to Command (locked)
  - Elevator

TODO features of the area: light, ceiling, floors, walls, doors, sounds, smells

See: Neon signs. Boarded storefronts. Laser bolts in the air. Camera drones flying. Combatants moving from cover to cover.

Hear: Shouts and combat commands. Station AI over loudspeaker declaring area is unsafe. Siren on fire drone putting out a burning barricade.

Smell: ozone and smoke.

The hallway to the elevator is clear on both sides, and in the middle of the hall are locked doors to Command and Broadcasting.

### Food Courts

The food courts at opposite ends of the promenade are active combat zones. Squads from all three factions are crouched behind overturned tables or behind the counters of the food stalls, shooting at anything that moves.

This is an incredibly unsafe place for the characters to be. To move through the area they need to succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or a DC 18 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failure, the character takes 3D6 radiant damage from a [**_Laser Pistol_**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol) bolt.

### Shops

All the shops are locked, with roll-down metal gates covering the doors. The lock on a gate can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. There's no one inside and the lights are off. No valuable equipment or coins can be found, but allow the players to roll once on the [Trinkets table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/equipment#Trinkets) if they like.

To describe the shop, choose a random store from your local mall or roll on the following table.

_Male Halfling Bard_

- Carnival barker outfit, slicked-back hair, easy smile
- Bombastic, sleazy
- Sounds like Tony Stark as a car salesman
- Can be found in Broadcasting

The Director’s confidence and charm masks a deep concern that the ratings are going to drop if he doesn’t keep increasing the stakes. He used every trick he had to capture the characters and is pinning all his hopes on their performance in the Arena.

When the characters break out of the Arena, he’s not upset, because their actions in the station are driving ratings even higher than when they were fighting. He’s started planning ways to complicate their lives, all in the name of good TV.

If the characters ask for anything, he refers them to the Commander, as if he can’t be bothered with such mundane concerns.

**Quote:** _“There they are, my favorite contestants! Nice hit out there, big guy! You know, our former director found these broadcasts a distasteful requirement. As I see it, we’re providing a valuable service. Public interest in history is at an all time high, viewership is through the roof, and more importantly, so is ad revenue!”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Remove the Professor:** The Director knows when he has a star on his hands. Your squad is a hit, and he’d be foolish to ignore that. He’d like nothing more than to allow you to capitalize on your stardom to live large, but he needs something from you first: Remove the Professor.

The protests and mutiny by #TeamEthics is really making it hard to maximize ratings, and it’s time for them to hand over control of the portal. No more scientists getting weak-kneed at the thought of a little blood.

If you can remove the Professor from power, then you can stay in the future and the Director will ensure that you live a life of wealth and fame like you’ve never experienced before. He asks only that you do it in the most entertaining way possible.

_Male Half-Elf Fighter_

- Balding, sloppy uniform
- Stubborn, put-upon
- Sounds like Sheriff Andy from True Blood
- Can be found in Command

In theory, the Commander runs the station, but in reality nearly every decision can be overruled by the Director in the name of ratings, leaving the Commander as a sort of sockpuppet. He chafes at this situation, and feels disrespected.

Most of all, however, he’s under pressure from Corporate to end the open combat on the station so they can resume the profitable business of space tourism. He secretly thinks Corporate would back him moving against the Director as long as ratings didn’t drop too badly, if it restored tourism. Still, he won’t move unless he’s sure it won’t blow up in his face.

**Quote:** _“This shit’s all gonna blow back on me, I just know it.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Remove the Professor & the Director:** The Commander thinks he’s found the perfect solution. Rather than letting the Director continue their awful broadcasts or allowing the Professor to shut down access to the portal, he wants to use the portal for history tourism. He’s got a proposal put together, but doesn’t dare send it, or someone else will take credit for it. If your group can remove both the Director and the Professor, however, he can make his pitch to corporate, and expect their backing.

In return, he will send you back to the past. The gladiator program will continue, but less bloodthirsty, and the dip in ratings will be made up for by tourist revenue.
