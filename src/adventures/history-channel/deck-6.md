Deck 6 consists of two massive rooms: the Shuttle Bay and the Cargo Bay. The Shuttle Bay is the site of an ongoing battle as the factions fight for resources on the automated supply shuttles that dock periodically. The Cargo Bay is a sprawling labyrinth of shelving and drones overseen by the Quartermaster.

## Shuttle Bay

_Contested Territory_

The Shuttle Bay is one large semicircular room with 6 docking hatches spaced evenly along the outside wall. The high ceilings have large, industrial light fixtures that brightly illuminate the cavernous space. There are painted lines on the floor detailing paths to each hatch and various other points. Periodically, a recorded announcement comes over the intercom announcing that all flights have been grounded by corporate order, with the exception of automated drone supply ships.

The Bay has clearly been the location of a longstanding struggle for control. There are laser scorch marks all over the walls, and some lights have been shot, causing them to flicker annoyingly. There are forklifts abandoned in the middle of the room, and one is a gutted wreck, still on fire, though a custodial drone sits nearby trying to spray foam to put out the flames.

A squad from each faction is huddled behind a makeshift shelter and barricade. [**Security Guards**](../part-2/#security-guards) from #TeamRatings have a choice spot near the rightmost docking hatch, while [**#TeamEthics Guards**](../part-3/#%23teamethics-guards) are camped out behind an overturned shipping container across the bay. The [**#OpsUnion guards**](../part-3/#%23opsunion-guards) are resting behind a tall barricade constructed in front of the large open hatch to the Cargo Bay.

It is clear that the battle is only on hold, and will flare up as soon as the next automated drone supply ship docks with the station.

### Control Tower

Above the elevator door, the Traffic Control Booth juts out, with angled glass walls giving a view of the entire bay. There is a small lift that can be used to access the booth, though it’s locked right now, and the booth is empty due to the flight lockdown.

If the characters gain entrance, there is a chance they could lift the lockdown, which the control booth has the power to override in case of emergency. Given at least 10 minutes to review the control board, if a character succeeds on a DC 25 Intelligence check, they can lift the lockdown.

### Docking Hatches

The six docking hatches are oversized airlocks designed to allow access to shuttles. They are all sealed from the inside due to the flight lockdown, though for safety reasons, they can always be opened from the outside.

### Docked Shuttle

Only one of the docking berths is occupied at the moment, but the hatch is sealed due to the flight lockdown.

If the characters gain entrance, the shuttle has a large open area near the back for cargo and a few rows of seats for passengers. At the front is the cockpit, with two seats and a confusing array of instruments the characters have no hope of understanding.

### Pilot’s Lounge

To the left of the elevator is a long room that follows the curve of the inner hull. It has large reinforced glass windows facing the Shuttle Bay, couches, display screens showing the broadcast, and a small bar with a robotic bartender. It feels like a cross between an airport lounge and a truck stop. There are large restrooms with showers, and even a few small capsule hotel-style sleeping pods, all of which can be rented via the robotic bartender. There is only one patron in the lounge, the Pilot, who is nursing a beer.

_Female Tiefling Rogue_

The Pilot cuts a dashing figure at the bar, in her flight suit and cowboy hat. Her aviator sunglasses can’t conceal the twinkle in her eyes as she beckons the characters over to talk to her.

She says she was stranded on the station when it went into lockdown. She’d been ferrying employees to and from the surface and now she can’t leave. She hangs out in the lounge, watching the broadcast, drinking, and grumbling about the lockdown.

Secretly, the Pilot is a spy from another corporation, sent to steal information about the time portal. She’s seen the characters on the broadcast and thinks they could help her. She has a way to blow the locks on her ship and will fly the characters out if they can acquire the plans for the portal and bring them to her.

The Pilot uses the stats for a [**Spy**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17021-spy).

**Personality:** Suave, sneaky, good under pressure.

**Quote:** _“Psst. Kid. Over here. You look capable. You help me out, and I’ll help you off the station.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Steal the Portal Plans:** The Pilot has been hired by a competing corporation to steal the plans for the portal. Unfortunately, she hasn’t been able to get access due to the fighting. The plans can be retrieved physically by removing the secure drive from the Portal Chamber or can be downloaded from any console if the Station AI grants access. In return, the Pilot offers to help you escape to the planet, to live out a new life in the future, perhaps doing freelance work like her.

## Cargo Bay

_Controlled by #OpsUnion_

The Cargo bay is a large semicircular room that mirrors the Shuttle Bay it’s connected to. The dimly lit space is filled with orderly shelves that stretch from floor to ceiling, each filled with bins and crates. Although everything is meticulously labeled, it’s all in some sort of machine code, and it’s not clear how anyone other than the Quartermaster would find anything in here.

The Quartermaster moves around the room, following patterns and moving items according to a system that only he understands, assisted at all times by a swarm of drones.

A makeshift barricade has been constructed a few feet in front of the open hatch to the Shuttle Bay, and a squad of [**#OpsUnion guards**](../part-3/#%23opsunion-guards) are crouched behind it. Their mission is to prevent attacks by #TeamRatings or #TeamEthics.

The hatch to the Cargo Tunnel is unguarded because there’s another barricade in the tunnel itself, one deck above near Life Support.

The entrance to the elevator has been completely barricaded with storage crates and is impassable.

_Rogue Modron Quadrone_

Rogue modrons are vanishingly rare, but highly sought after due to their organizational skills, and the Quartermaster has become particularly well-regarded on the station, running an orderly cargo bay and keeping supplies moving smoothly through the cargo tunnels.

At all times, the Quartermaster is surrounded by and directing a swarm of bird-sized drones, who communicate via short bursts of what sounds like static and chirping. He will periodically interrupt a conversation to respond to a particularly urgent-looking drone. It is unclear to an observer what these drones are doing or capable of.

Until the fighting ends, he has orders not to allow anyone to take supplies from the Cargo Bay without permission from the Chief. He finds this whole situation very stressful. #OpsUnion has sent guards to prevent looting and raiding, but until combat ends, all he can do is keep the cargo bay orderly and wait for the dark times to pass.

To the surprise of the characters, The Quartermaster remembers them fondly. He claims that they met centuries ago, and is grateful for the assistance they provided at the time. When it becomes clear that the characters don’t remember this (because it hasn’t happened to them yet), he refuses to provide further details, for fear of affecting the timestream. Nevertheless, he remains well-disposed towards the characters and will do what he can to help them, including introducing them to the Chief if they want.

The Quartermaster uses the stats for a [**Quadrone**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17178-quadrone).

**Personality:** Helpful, organized, guileless.

**Quote:** _“It’s good to see you! It has been 18.2 centuries. Please try not to track blood on my floor.”_
