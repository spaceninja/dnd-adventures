TK intro

## Cargo Bay

- Controlled by Ops Union
- Exits
  - Hatch to Shuttle Bay (guarded)
  - Cargo Tunnel (unguarded, behind Life Support barricade)
  - Elevator (barricaded)
- Notable NPCs: Quartermaster

The Cargo bay is a large semicircular room that mirrors the Cargo Bay it’s connected to. The space is filled with orderly shelves that stretch from floor to ceiling, each filled with meticulously labeled bins and crates. The labels are not in common, and it’s not clear how anyone other than the Quartermaster would find anything in here.

There are guards manning the barricade by the hatch to the Shuttle Bay, but the hatch to the Cargo Tunnel is unguarded because it’s behind the larger barricade one deck above at Life Support.

The Quartermaster moves around the room, following patterns and moving items according to a system that only he understands, assisted at all times by his swarm of drones.

### The Quartermaster

- Nordom, the last Modron
- Helpful, guileless, optimistic
- Sounds like Nordom
- Can be found in Cargo Bay
- Can introduce to Chief if needed

“It’s good to see you! It has been 38.2 centuries. Please try not to track blood on my floor.”

Nordom remembers the characters fondly from when they met centuries ago. It is grateful for their assistance at the time, and it is proud that it is the last Modron on this plane of existence. Thankfully, life has been much less dangerous in recent centuries, and Nordom has become a well-regarded quartermaster on the station, running an orderly cargo bay and keeping supplies moving smoothly through the station’s cargo tunnels.

As a result, Nordom finds this whole situation very stressful. Ops Union has sent guards to prevent looting and raiding, but until combat ends, all Nordom can do is keep the cargo bay orderly and wait for the dark times to pass.

Until the fighting ends, Nordom has orders not to allow anyone to take supplies from the Cargo Bay without permission from the Chief

At all times, Nordom is surrounded by and directing a swarm of bird-sized drones, who communicate via short bursts of what sounds like static and chirping. Nordom will periodically interrupt a conversation to respond to a particularly urgent-looking drone. It is unclear to an observer what these drones are doing or capable of.

Nordom uses the stats for a [Quadrone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quadrone).

## Shuttle Bay

- Contested Territory
- Exits:
  - Hatch to Cargo Bay (guarded)
  - Elevator
  - Airlock
- Notable NPCs: Pilot

The Shuttle Bay is one large semicircular room with 6 docking hatches spaced evenly along the outside wall. Only one hatch is currently occupied, with a passenger shuttle docked to the station. The room has painted lines on the floor detailing paths to each hatch and various other points. Periodically, a recorded announcement comes over the intercom announcing that all flights have been grounded by order of Corporate, with the exception of automated drone supply ships.

Above the elevator door the Traffic Control Booth juts out, with angled glass walls giving a view of the entire bay. There is a small lift that can be used to access the booth, though it’s locked down right now, and the booth is empty due to the flight lockdown.

To the left of the elevator is a walled-off Lounge area with couches, display screens, and a small bar with a robotic bartender. It feels like a cross between an airport lounge and a truck stop. There are large restrooms with showers, and even a few small capsule-hotel style sleeping pods, all of which can be rented via the robotic bartender. There is only one patron in the lounge, the Pilot, who is nursing a beer.

The Bay has clearly been the location of a longstanding struggle for control. There are laser scorch marks all over the walls, and some lights have been shot, causing them to flicker annoyingly. There are forklifts abandoned in the middle of the room, and one is a gutted wreck, still on fire, though a custodial drone sits nearby trying to spray foam to put out the flames.

You can see a squad from each faction huddled behind a makeshift shelter and barricade. The Security Guards from #TeamRatings have a choice spot near the rightmost docking hatch, while #TeamEthics is camped out behind an overturned shipping container across the bay. The Ops Union squad is resting behind a tall barricade constructed in front of a large open hatch labeled Cargo Bay.

It is clear that the battle is only on hold, and will flare up as soon as the next automated drone supply ship docks with the station.

### The Pilot

- Female Tiefling
- Aviator sunglasses, cowboy hat, dark blue scales, flight suit
- Sneaky, capable
- Sounds like a female Han Solo
- Can be found in Shuttle Bay

“Psst. Kid. Over here. You look capable. You help me out, and I’ll help you off the station.”

The Pilot was stranded on the station when it went into lockdown. She was ferrying employees between the ground and the station and now she can’t leave. She hangs out on her ship, grumbling about not being able to leave.

Secretly, the Pilot is a spy for another Corporation, sent to steal information about the portal. She has a way to blow the locks on her ship and and will fly the characters out if they can acquire the plans for the portal and bring them to her.

#### Quest: Steal the Portal Plans

The Pilot has been hired by a competing megacorp to steal the plans for the portal. Unfortunately, she hasn’t been able to get access due to the fighting. The plans can be retrieved physically by removing the secure drive from the Portal Chamber, or can be downloaded from any console if the Station AI grants access.

In return, the Pilot offers to help you escape to the planet, to live out a new life in the future, perhaps doing freelance work like her.

Reward: Escape to the planet
