## Appendix A: Researching Yourself Minigame

The characters are notorious historical figures, and as a result, they have wiki pages of questionable accuracy dedicated to their lives and crimes. If the characters try to look themselves up, it should trigger a little minigame. For each of the following sections, have the player roll on the table for a prompt.

Have the player elaborate on the prompt to explain what’s in their wiki page. The information doesn’t have to be accurate — this isn’t a character-building prompt, it’s an explanation of why the future thinks the character is a villain. Encourage the players to have fun, and maybe incorporate some of the results into their interactions with NPCs on the station.

### Early Life

This section of the wiki page helps to establish how the character’s childhood led to their eventual life of crime.

| d10 | Prompt                         |
| --- | :----------------------------- |
| 1   | Born with a tail/evil omen     |
| 2   | Traumatic childhood            |
| 3   | Grew up poor                   |
| 4   | Troubled childhood             |
| 5   | Unremarkable childhood         |
| 6   | Unremarkable childhood         |
| 7   | Spoiled childhood              |
| 8   | Grew up rich                   |
| 9   | Remarkable childhood           |
| 10  | Divine birth (citation needed) |

### Gang Membership

This section of the wiki covers the character’s time with the adventuring party, referred to as the character’s “gang,” and establishes how the future views their participation in the gang’s crimes.

| d10 | Prompt                   |
| --- | :----------------------- |
| 1   | Not actually in the gang |
| 2   | Gang mascot              |

| 8   | Enthusiastic participant |
| 9   | Gang ringleader          |
| 10  | Gang founder             |

### Post-Gang Life

This section of the wiki covers the character’s life after leaving the gang, and probably includes their death. Encourage the players to go big here. Think “war crimes” not “robbery.” There’s a reason they’re notorious in the future.

| 9   | Prison                     |
| 10  | Exploded (citation needed) |

### Historical Perspective

This section covers the historical consensus of the character and what sort of view the future takes of their crimes and impact on the world.
