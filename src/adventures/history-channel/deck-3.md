TODO: Medical should be open, neutral, treating all sides

Lobby looks like any hospital waiting room, but over the shoulder of the receptionist, you can see the facility is overflowing with patients. They are in every room, but also lying on gurneys in the hall or even just standing around and sitting on the floor. Nurses and doctors in lab coats are running around conducting triage, trying to help, but it’s clear they’re running out of key supplies. The patients are mostly in green uniforms, but there are some tan and red uniforms as well.

Eventually the Dcot comes through. She is constantly being interrupted by other doctors and nurses asking her for information or to make a judgement call. She eventually loses her patience moving through and demands that the hallways be cleared by moving patients into the the lobby.

This should give the players a chance to be altruistic. If the Doc sees them trying to help, she will take an interest and strike up a conversation. Unless they are total jerks to her, she’ll invite them back to her office and offer her quest.

_Lawful Good Elf Cleric_

- Tall, blonde ponytail, glasses, lab coat
- Frustrated, tense, determined
- Sounds like Alice Quinn from the Magicians
- Can be found in Medical

The Chief Medical Officer (known universally as "the Doc") had an easy job before the mutiny, with nothing more difficult than the occasional chemical burn or tourist with a sprained ankle. Now, however, her sick bay is crammed full of injuries and they’re running low on supplies. She doesn’t care too much about the ethics of time travel, but wants the fighting to end.

She has a plan that she hasn’t told anyone about yet. She believes if the station’s ability to broadcast were destroyed, then the factions would have nothing left to fight about, and things would settle down. She’s willing to use her medical emergency override code to let the characters into the portal chamber if they will stop the broadcast.

The Doc uses the stats for a [**Priest**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16985-priest).

**Personality.** TK, TK, TK.

**Quote.** _“This whole situation is idiotic. We’re running out of medical supplies and pretty soon people are going to start dying when I can’t treat them.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Stop the Broadcast:** The Doc think she’s found the solution to the problem: If there’s no broadcast, there’s no reason for everyone to keep fighting over the broadcast. If you can stop the broadcast by sabotaging the equipment (either from Broadcasting itself, or by destroying the comms gear on the Station Exterior), the Doc can get you access to the portal to go home.

### The Mad Scientist

  </div>
</figure>

_Chaotic Evil Gnome Wizard_

- Chained to wall, wild lavender hair, big eyes, constantly typing
- Distracted, twitchy, excitable, flirtatious, unaware she’s a bad guy
- Sounds like Kate McKinnon in Ghostbusters 2
- Can be found in Medical
- Unaffiliated, but imprisoned by #TeamEthics

The Mad Scientist led the team that discovered how to open time portals, and has been frantically exploiting the tech ever since. She knows it’s only a matter of time (heh) before the secret leaks, and she wants to publish as many papers as possible before that happens.

She dreams of having her name in the history books alongside other greats, and frankly is unconcerned that her experiments might be unethical, or if people die, or even if the timeline itself is destabilized. She believes you can’t make progress being cautious.

The Mad Scientist uses the stats for a [**Cult Fanatic**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16836-cult-fanatic).

**Personality.** TK, TK, TK.

**Quote.** _“This is all terribly exciting. I wish they’d restore my access to the live feeds of the portal. The implications of what we’re doing here will affect every field of science. I’ve written 3 papers since they locked me up, but they won’t let me submit them. It doesn’t matter. There’s too much opportunity here to be afraid of cracking a few eggs. No offense to you eggs, of course.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Return the Mad Scientist to the Portal Chamber:** The Mad Scientist desperately wants to return to her work. If the characters can free her and return her to the Portal Chamber, she can seal it to prevent anyone from interfering.

As a reward, she will send the characters anywhere/when they want to go.

R&D looks like any university science department. Long hallways with corkboards covered in printouts, whiteboards filled with formulas and notes, and many doorways opening to labs filled with harried-looking scientists and engineers doing work. Some unoccupied labs or offices are filled with sleeping guards and off-duty scientists, who clearly have nowhere else to sleep since R&D was blocked off from the rest of the station.

### Director of Research & Development's Office

The Professor’s office is located down a side hallway, and has a nameplate with the name of the Mad Scientist listed as the head of the department. This has been crudely crossed out and a printed sign hung below with the Professor’s name instead.

Professor’s office is lined with bookcases filled with obscure tomes and research, and a large standing desk that the Professor works from. There is a couch and several chairs in the room for meetings.

### The Professor

</figure>

_Lawful Good Sentient Weapon wielded by Human Barbarian_

The Director of Research & Development is an ancient sentient weapon, who everyone simply calls "The Professor." They date back to only a century or so after the characters’ time period. They eventually tired of mindless combat, became a pacifist, and started studying. Over time, they grew well-regarded in the science community, and until recently, were quite happy working in the research department as a professor of transdimensional ethics.

However, they could not ignore the Mad Scientist’s abuses of space-time for long. They sparked the mutiny when they convinced the rest of the research team to lock up the Mad Scientist. They’ve since been put in charge of #TeamEthics, and have continued to find alarming indications that messing with the timeline could have dire consequences. They want to end the gladiator programs, return everyone to their proper timeline, and then start a series of less intrusive historical documentaries using drones.

The Professor uses the stats for a [**Champion**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin-warlord), but is a pacifist and will not fight under any circumstances.

**Personality.** Intelligent, calm, serious.

**Quote.** _“I’ve done the math, and there are some troubling implications. We could be doing irreparable harm to spacetime.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Remove the Director:** The Professor worries that all the abuse of the timestream by the Director is going to cause catastrophic consequences. They want to immediately stop all broadcasts, return the “contestants” to their proper times, and conduct more study of the portal itself. If you can remove the Director from power, then the Professor will send you back to your time and stop the abductions for good.

#### Sentient Weapons

[Sentient weapons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#SentientMagicItems) form a bond with a living creature who volunteers to be their agent. When the two are in contact (either holding or carrying the weapon), then a psychic bond is formed, allowing the weapon to speak through its agent. If the two are separated, the weapon can still project its thoughts to anyone who touches it, but it cannot command someone it has not bonded with.
