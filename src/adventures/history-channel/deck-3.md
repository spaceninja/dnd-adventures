## Medical

_Controlled by #TeamEthics_

> TODO: read-aloud description

- offices, waiting room, exam rooms, trauma center
- Exits:
  - Hatch to Research
  - Airlock
  - Elevator (guarded)

TODO features of the area: light, ceiling, floors, walls, doors, sounds, smells

TODO: Medical should be open, neutral, treating all sides

Lobby looks like any hospital waiting room, but over the shoulder of the receptionist, you can see the facility is overflowing with patients. They are in every room, but also lying on gurneys in the hall or even just standing around and sitting on the floor. Nurses and doctors in lab coats are running around conducting triage, trying to help, but it’s clear they’re running out of key supplies. The patients are mostly in green uniforms, but there are some tan and red uniforms as well.

Eventually the Dcot comes through. She is constantly being interrupted by other doctors and nurses asking her for information or to make a judgement call. She eventually loses her patience moving through and demands that the hallways be cleared by moving patients into the the lobby.

This should give the players a chance to be altruistic. If the Doc sees them trying to help, she will take an interest and strike up a conversation. Unless they are total jerks to her, she’ll invite them back to her office and offer her quest.

_Lawful Good Elf Cleric_

- Tall, blonde ponytail, glasses, lab coat
- Frustrated, tense, determined
- Sounds like Alice Quinn from the Magicians
- Can be found in Medical

The Chief Medical Officer (known universally as "the Doc") had an easy job before the mutiny, with nothing more difficult than the occasional chemical burn or tourist with a sprained ankle. Now, however, her sick bay is crammed full of injuries and they’re running low on supplies. She doesn’t care too much about the ethics of time travel, but wants the fighting to end.

She has a plan that she hasn’t told anyone about yet. She believes if the station’s ability to broadcast were destroyed, then the factions would have nothing left to fight about, and things would settle down. She’s willing to use her medical emergency override code to let the characters into the portal chamber if they will stop the broadcast.

The Doc uses the stats for a [**Priest**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16985-priest).

**Personality.** TK, TK, TK.

**Quote.** _“This whole situation is idiotic. We’re running out of medical supplies and pretty soon people are going to start dying when I can’t treat them.”_

**Suggested Names.** Alice Hargraven, Quinn Elgrove, Erin Ardhave

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Stop the Broadcast:** The Doc think she’s found the solution to the problem: If there’s no broadcast, there’s no reason for everyone to keep fighting over the broadcast. If you can stop the broadcast by sabotaging the equipment (either from Broadcasting itself, or by destroying the comms gear on the Station Exterior), the Doc can get you access to the portal to go home.

### The Mad Scientist

</figure>

_Chaotic Evil Gnome Wizard_

- Chained to wall, wild lavender hair, big eyes, constantly typing
- Distracted, twitchy, excitable, flirtatious, unaware she’s a bad guy
- Sounds like Kate McKinnon in Ghostbusters 2
- Can be found in Medical
- Unaffiliated, but imprisoned by #TeamEthics

The Mad Scientist led the team that discovered how to open time portals, and has been frantically exploiting the tech ever since. She knows it’s only a matter of time (heh) before the secret leaks, and she wants to publish as many papers as possible before that happens.

She dreams of having her name in the history books alongside other greats, and frankly is unconcerned that her experiments might be unethical, or if people die, or even if the timeline itself is destabilized. She believes you can’t make progress being cautious.

The Mad Scientist uses the stats for a [**Cult Fanatic**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16836-cult-fanatic).

**Personality.** TK, TK, TK.

**Quote.** _“This is all terribly exciting. I wish they’d restore my access to the live feeds of the portal. The implications of what we’re doing here will affect every field of science. I’ve written 3 papers since they locked me up, but they won’t let me submit them. It doesn’t matter. There’s too much opportunity here to be afraid of cracking a few eggs. No offense to you eggs, of course.”_

**Suggested Names.** Irma Dazzlebranch, Kate Wobblespell, Tatiana Buzzwire

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Return the Mad Scientist to the Portal Chamber:** The Mad Scientist desperately wants to return to her work. If the characters can free her and return her to the Portal Chamber, she can seal it to prevent anyone from interfering.

As a reward, she will send the characters anywhere/when they want to go.

## Research & Development

_Controlled by #TeamEthics_

> The walls of the R&D corridor are lined with corkboards filled with printouts, and whiteboards covered in formulas and notes. The doorways open onto labs filled with distracted scientists and engineers doing their best to continue their research. A few offices are occupied by sleeping guards and off-duty scientists. Security is heavy near the entrance to the Portal Chamber.

A pair of guards man a checkpoint near the cargo tunnel entrance, and the elevator door has been blockaded on this side to prevent access. The doors at either end of the long semicircular hallway open onto Medical, and are locked, allowing access only to #TeamEthics.

### Portal Chamber

The Portal chamber might be the most heavily guarded spot on the station. The guards are particularly vigiliant since the recent #TeamRatings raid (when they abducted the characters), and they are unlikely to gain entrance without permission from the Professor.

Inside is a large room dominated by the portal itself: a large metal circle bristling with sensors and mechanical connections. The portal is currently inactive, and the chamber itself unoccupied, by order of the Professor.

When active, the center of the circle fills with a haze that emits a dull coppery light. The circle crackles with electricity, and through the haze a dim vision of the connected location is visible.

Surrounding the portal are multiple workstations, all displaying readouts with data from the portal. A large computer is build into the primary console, used to control the portal. Attached to it is a secure drive containing the schematics and blueprints for the portal. The secure drive can be removed easily, but unless they have been told what to look for by the Pilot, the characters must make a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to identify it.

### Labs

The labs are filled with advanced equipment that the players can barely understand. There are no microscopes, bunsen burners, or bubbling flasks here. Instead, complex machinery and sensors are connected to computer workstations. Whirring fabricators have been put to use printing armor for guards. Caution signs warn of active lasers and toxic fumes. Safety equipment is abdundant, including fire extinguishers and eye wash stations.

### Offices

The offices are all shared by at least 3-4 researchers. Each office has several desks, laptops and tablet computers, bookshelves filled with complicated reference material the characters can't understand. Several whiteboards are covered with diagrams and formulas, sometimes with sticky notes reading "DO NOT ERASE!!!"

### Director of Research & Development's Office

The Professor’s office has a sign with the name of the Mad Scientist listed as the head of the department. This has been crudely crossed out and a printed sign hung below with the Professor’s name instead.

Inside, the wall is lined with bookcases willed with both antique leather-bound tomes and more current periodicals and books. An ornate-looking wooden desk has been shoved into the corner and replaced with a simple standing desk that the Professor works from. There is a comfortable couch along one wall and several chairs for meetings.

At any given time, the Professor is likely to be standing at their desk writing something, or sitting with their department heads discussing plans.

### The Professor

</figure>

_Lawful Good Sentient Weapon wielded by Human Barbarian_

The Director of Research & Development is an ancient sentient weapon, who everyone simply calls "The Professor." They date back to only a century or so after the characters’ time period. They eventually tired of mindless combat, became a pacifist, and started studying. Over time, they grew well-regarded in the science community, and until recently, were quite happy working in the research department as a professor of transdimensional ethics.

However, they could not ignore the Mad Scientist’s abuses of space-time for long. They sparked the mutiny when they convinced the rest of the research team to lock up the Mad Scientist. They’ve since been put in charge of #TeamEthics, and have continued to find alarming indications that messing with the timeline could have dire consequences. They want to end the gladiator programs, return everyone to their proper timeline, and then start a series of less intrusive historical documentaries using drones.

The Professor uses the stats for a [**Champion**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin-warlord), but is a pacifist and will not fight under any circumstances.

**Personality.** Intelligent, calm, serious.

**Quote.** _“I’ve done the math, and there are some troubling implications. We could be doing irreparable harm to spacetime.”_

**Suggested Names.** Durendal, Masamune, Mac an Luin

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Remove the Director:** The Professor worries that all the abuse of the timestream by the Director is going to cause catastrophic consequences. They want to immediately stop all broadcasts, return the “contestants” to their proper times, and conduct more study of the portal itself. If you can remove the Director from power, then the Professor will send you back to your time and stop the abductions for good.

#### Sentient Weapons

[Sentient weapons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#SentientMagicItems) form a bond with a living creature who volunteers to be their agent. When the two are in contact (either holding or carrying the weapon), then a psychic bond is formed, allowing the weapon to speak through its agent. If the two are separated, the weapon can still project its thoughts to anyone who touches it, but it cannot command someone it has not bonded with.
