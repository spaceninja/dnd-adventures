# {{ title }}

Abducted to the future and forced to compete in televised arena combat, the characters must find a way to escape an endless cycle of violence and death. _The Future Hates You!_ is an adventure for characters of 5th to 10th level. It is set on a space station in the distant future where the characters are known as notorious criminals, and contains science fiction elements, including time travel.

## Adventure Background

The space station was built decades ago by a multinational effort the world had never seen before. At first, the science performed on the station enjoyed broad public support, but over time the funding dried up. Eventually the station was sold to a entertainment megacorp, Historia Kanalo, who kept the R&D department funded with tourism to the station.

Five years ago, the scientists achieved their greatest breakthrough: the creation of a portal through spacetime. It allowed scientists to not only look into the past, but actually retrieve items. All science on the station was immediately focused on the portal and the fascinating implications of time travel.

While documentaries incorporating live footage of history events initially provided a boost in viewership, the public’s interest waned quickly. Faced with falling ratings, corporate leadership promoted the Director to run all programming on the station based on his pitch for a show about forcing notorious criminals abducted from the past to engage in gladiatorial combat.

It was a wild success, not least because of the controversy around the ethics of the program. The Director doubled down, crafting bloodier and more extreme matches for successive seasons. The addition of cloning vats allowed the “contestants” to be killed one night and back on the field the next. Ratings and controversy increased in lockstep.

However, the Professor discovered that this use of the portal could cause severe damage to the timestream. They advocated for ceasing the arena combat, returning all contestants to their time periods, and returning to less invasive historical drone footage.

The station was divided, with roughly half the crew supporting the Director, and the rest falling in with the scientists. The tension boiled over into mutiny, which, naturally, the Director broadcast as a reality show, with fan favorites, gossip and social media.

When the scientists imprisoned the former head of R&D for unethical experiments, supporters of the Director began dismissively referring to them as **#TeamEthics**, and were themselves branded **#TeamRatings**.

Sections of the station were claimed and defended by the factions. Team Ethics barricaded themselves on the Science deck, with control over Medical, Research and the Portal Chamber itself. The Director, claiming support from Corporate as long as the ratings stayed up, kept control of Broadcasting and Command, and authorized Security to lock down the Arena.

The rest of the station is contested territory, with the exception of the Engineering deck, which is controlled by the **Ops Union**, who remain neutral and only care about keeping the station operational.

When open combat broke out, Corporate evacuated the tourists and grounded all flights except cargo drone supply ships. Ostensibly, this was to avoid tourist injuries, but it was actually to maintain exclusive broadcast rights by not allowing other news channels on board.

After losing control of the portal, with no fresh “contestants”, and facing concerns about how long ratings would stay up, the Director authorized a daring raid on the Portal Chamber. Team Ethics were able to repel the raiders eventually, but not before the characters were pulled through the portal. For reasons unknown to the players, they are known in the future as legendary villains, and their upcoming debut in the arena has generated a lot of viewer excitement.

#### Why don’t the NPCs have names?

I prefer to let my players name all my NPCs. I’ve found it helps the players feel some ownership over the story, and they always come up with more creative and funny names than I would anyway. As a result, I refer to all the NPCs by title.

## Adventure Synopsis

This scenario begins when the characters wake on the outskirts of a raging battle in a large arena. They quickly realize they are on a space station where notorious criminals from throughout history have been abducted and are forced to fight on a reality show.

The daily arena combat is introduced by the Director, a flamboyant figure who dresses and acts like a carnival barker. He can be seen on an enormous screen overhead, which shows what’s being broadcast, a scoreboard, and an unending stream of commentary from viewers.

The characters eventually escape into the main station, where they find the crew in open conflict over this abuse of time travel. The station inhabitants have split into opposing factions: Team Ratings and Team Ethics, as well as the unaffiliated Ops Union who just want to keep the station from exploding.

The characters will need to choose what to do and who to help. Return to the past or stay in the future? Help one faction win over the others, or blow up the portal so it can’t be abused anymore?

## Adventure Hooks

### How did we get here?

The last thing the characters remember is seeing an unusually bright light, then they find themselves in the arena with no memory of how they came to be here. It feels as though no time has passed and they are extremely disoriented.

### A shifty recruiter

The characters were approached in a bar by a man wearing odd clothes. He spoke Common, but gave the impression of being foreign. He seemed to know a lot about them, and exactly what to offer to tempt them. In exchange, he asked them to participate in a sort of contest. They remember agreeing, and then awaken in the arena, sensing they were drugged, and cursing the recruiter.

### Taken by force

The characters were ambushed on the road. Their attackers were oddly dressed, wearing strange black armor and carrying unusual weapons that fired bolts of light that rendered them unconscious. They awaken in the arena, groggy and upset.

## DM Overview

This scenario is designed to be very flexible to however the characters choose to proceed. However, here are a few key moments that can be used to keep the plot moving forward:

### In the Arena

Allow the characters to fight and die a few times in the arena. It should be clear that while they may win some fights, continuing to fight is a losing proposition, and there’s no obvious escape from the arena.

The Director’s running commentary during combat and the audience reactions on the board during the Arena fights are powerful exposition tools. Use them to explain what’s going on. Make it clear to the players that they are regarded as notorious criminals, and the audience is rooting for them to be killed. Have the Director mock the characters for every missed attack, and the audience cheer when they’re hit. Pull no punches and send them to the cloning vats once or twice to really drive home how bad their situation is.

Allow them to spot the Champion, effortlessly holding her own in battle, and hint that she seems to be protecting a small woman (the Strategist) who’s not fighting, but studying odd things in the Arena like welding seams and how deep the dirt floor is, as if she’s looking for weak points.

If they start to get bored, or look like they need a hint, have the Champion approach them directly, and say the Strategist wants to speak to them. Explain that she’s been watching them, and thinks they could be helpful to her plan.

### Exploring

Once they escape the arena, allow them some time to explore the station and learn about the world they’ve found themselves in.

Do your best to steer them towards the bar, where the Bartender can offer them a job to retrieve supplies from the Cargo Bay, which will get them moving through the station.

If they’re not interested or don’t go near the bar, try having the Director summon them to a meeting personally, where he can explain that he’d like to make them stars if they take out the Professor.

### Engineering

If they don’t head towards Engineering at some point, try having some panicked engineers run past, or some alarming announcements over the intercom to make it clear the station is in danger of exploding. If all else fails, try having the Chief reach out to the directly to ask for help.

### The Portal

Eventually, the players will probably be motivated to make their way to the Portal Chamber, but if they don’t, the Professor could reach out directly (though they’re probably the last to do so after the Director and the Chief).

### Security Guards

Any time the characters are in contested territory, consider throwing a random encounter with Security Guards their direction. Unless they’re actively working with #TeamRatings, Security is probably hunting for them.

### Suggestions

This is an open-ended scenario that’s meant to reward creative thinking and solutions over combat. If they find a clever shortcut or way to avoid something you had planned, that’s great! Let the players feel clever while you look for another way to increase the pressure.

Finally, do your best to avoid picking a “good ending” and steering your players towards it. Returning to the past, staying in the future, or even using the portal to go somewhere new are all viable solutions. Try to run with what your players are interested in.

#### A Note on Time Travel

This scenario uses a version of the [multiversal rules of time travel](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/04/the-new-marvel-rules-of-time-travel-courtesy-of-battle-of-the-atom-spoilers/). In a nutshell: Any time travel creates an additional timeline. This is one of many possible futures for the characters, and changes they make can keep them from ending up in this timeline.

That said, time travel is a plot device to be used in service of your players’ stories, and you should feel free to change or ignore these rules if it makes your game more fun.

Time travel gets messy quickly. If your players are getting bogged down in the mechanics of it, you might gently remind them that: A) their characters are not scientists, B) the actual scientists are still figuring out how it all works, and C) they have more pressing concerns.
