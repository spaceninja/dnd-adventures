# {{ title }}

Abducted to the future and forced to compete in broadcast arena combat, the characters must find a way to escape an endless cycle of violence and death. _The Future Hates You!_ is an adventure for characters of 5th to 10th level. It is set on a space station in the distant future where the characters are known as notorious criminals, and contains science fiction elements, including time travel.

## Adventure Background

The space station was built decades ago by a multinational effort the world had never seen before. At first, the science performed on the station enjoyed broad public support, but over time the funding dried up. Eventually the station was sold to a entertainment megacorp, Historia Kanalo, who kept the R&D department funded by space tourism.

Five years ago, the scientists achieved their greatest breakthrough: time travel. Documentaries with live footage of historical events provided a boost in viewership, but public interest waned. Faced with falling ratings, corporate leadership brought in a new Director based on his pitch for a show about gladiatorial combat between history's most notorious criminals.

It was a wild success, not least due to the debate around the ethics of the program. The addition of cloning vats allowed a “contestant” to be killed one night and back on the field the next. Ratings and controversy increased in lockstep.

Then the research team discovered that continued use of the time portal could cause instabilities in the timestream. They released a statement calling for the immediate end of the arena combat program, the return of all contestants to their original time period, and resuming less invasive historical drone footage.

The division among station staff escalated to a full-blown mutiny. Corporate evacuated the tourists. The scientists barricaded the science deck and imprisoned the former head of R&D for unethical experimentation. The Director siezed the opportunity to broadcast the conflict as a reality show. The public branded the two factions as **#TeamEthics** and **#TeamRatings**.

Knowing his support from Corporate depended on keeping ratings up, the Director authorized a raid on the Portal Chamber. Team Ethics were able to repel the raiders, but not before the characters were pulled through the portal. For reasons unknown to the players, they are amongh the future's most legendary villains, and their upcoming debut in the arena has generated a lot of viewer excitement.

## Adventure Synopsis

This scenario begins when the characters wake in a holding pen in a large arena. They quickly realize they are on a space station where notorious criminals from throughout history are abducted and forced into gladiatorial combat.

The daily arena combat is introduced by the Director, a flamboyant figure who dresses and acts like a carnival barker. He can be seen on an enormous screen overhead, which displays what’s being broadcast, a scoreboard, and an unending stream of commentary from viewers.

The characters eventually escape into the main station, where they find the crew in open conflict over the abuse of time travel. The station inhabitants have split into opposing factions: Team Ratings and Team Ethics, as well as the unaffiliated Ops Union who just want to keep the station from exploding.

The characters will need to choose what to do and who to help. Return to the past or stay in the future? Help one faction win over the others, or blow up the portal so it can’t be abused anymore?

#### A Note on Time Travel

This scenario uses a version of the [multiversal rules of time travel](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/04/the-new-marvel-rules-of-time-travel-courtesy-of-battle-of-the-atom-spoilers/). In a nutshell: Any time travel creates an additional timeline. This is only one of many possible futures for the characters, and changes they make in the past can keep them from ending up in this timeline.

That said, time travel is a plot device best used in service of your players’ stories, and you should feel free to change or ignore these rules if it makes your game more fun.

Time travel gets messy quickly. If your players are getting bogged down in the mechanics of it, you might gently remind them that: A) their characters are not scientists, B) the actual scientists are still figuring out how it all works, and C) they have more pressing concerns.

## Adventure Hooks

### How did we get here?

The last thing the characters remember is seeing an unusually bright light, then they find themselves in the arena with no memory of how they came to be here. It feels as though no time has passed and they are extremely disoriented.

### A shifty recruiter

The characters were approached in a bar by a man wearing odd clothes. He spoke Common, but gave the impression of being foreign. He seemed to know a lot about them, and exactly what to offer to tempt them. In exchange, he asked them to participate in a sort of contest. They remember agreeing, and then awaken in the arena, sensing they were drugged, and cursing the recruiter.

### Taken by force

The characters were ambushed on the road. Their attackers were oddly dressed, wearing strange black armor and carrying unusual weapons that fired bolts of light that rendered them unconscious. They awaken in the arena, groggy and upset.

## DM Overview

This scenario is designed to be very flexible. However, here are a few key moments that can be used to keep the story moving forward:

### In the Arena

**They can't win:** Allow the characters to fight, but pull no punches. Let them die, and send them to the cloning vats once or twice to really drive home how bad their situation is. It should be clear that continuing to fight is a losing proposition.

**The Director taunts them:** The Director’s running commentary and the audience reactions on the board are powerful exposition tools. Make it clear to the players that they are regarded as notorious criminals, and the audience is rooting for them to be killed. Have the Director mock the characters for every missed attack, and the audience cheer when they’re hit.

**The Strategist is the way out:** Allow them to spot the Champion, effortlessly holding her own in battle, and hint that she seems to be protecting a small woman (the Strategist) who’s not fighting, but studying odd things in the Arena like welding seams and how deep the dirt floor is, as if she’s looking for weak points. If they don't investigate, have the Champion approach to say the Strategist wants to speak to them.

### Exploring

**The Bar is a good first stop:** Once they escape the arena, allow them some time to explore the station and learn about the world they’ve found themselves in. Do your best to steer them towards the Bar, where the Bartender can offer them a job to retrieve supplies from the Cargo Bay, which will get them moving through the station.

**Security Guards:** Any time the characters are in contested territory, consider throwing a random encounter with Security Guards their direction. Unless they’re actively working with #TeamRatings, Security is probably hunting for them.

**Camera Drones:** Whenever the characters enter contested territory or an area controlled by #TeamRatings, there should be Camera Drones following them. The Director can see anything the Drones see.

### Meeting NPCs:

If the players are having fun exploring, let them decide where to go. But if they seem unsure what to do next, consider having an NPC summon them directly to a meeting.

**The Director wants to make them stars:** If they’re not interested or don’t go near the bar, try having the Director summon them to a meeting personally, where he can explain that he’d like to make them stars if they take out the Professor.

**The Chief Engineer needs to keep the station from exploding:** If they don’t head towards Engineering at some point, try having some panicked engineers run past, or some alarming announcements over the intercom to make it clear the station is in danger of exploding. If all else fails, try having the Chief reach out to the directly to ask for help.

**The Professor wants to stop the Director:** Eventually, the players will probably be motivated to make their way to the Portal Chamber, but if they don’t, the Professor could reach out directly to offer a way home if they stop the Director (though they’re probably the last to do so after the Director and the Chief).

#### Why don’t the NPCs have names?

I prefer to let my players name all my NPCs. I’ve found it helps the players feel some ownership over the story, and they always come up with more creative and funny names than I would anyway. As a result, I refer to all the NPCs by title.

### Suggestions

**Let the players be clever:** This is an open-ended scenario that’s meant to reward creative thinking and solutions over combat. If they find a clever shortcut or way to avoid something you had planned, that’s great! Let the players feel clever while you look for another way to increase the pressure.

**Let the players pick an ending:** Nearly every NPC offers a different way to resolve this scenario. Do your best to avoid picking a “good ending” to steer your players towards. Returning to the past, staying in the future, or even using the portal to go somewhere new are all viable outcomes. Try to run with what your players are interested in.
