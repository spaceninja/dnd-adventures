# {{ title }}

The characters find themselves in a confusing new reality and are immediately caught up in an overwhelming battle.

## Into the Fray

When everyone is ready to begin, roll for initiative. Then read or paraphrase the following aloud:

> You awaken on one side of a large open space. You sit up, wiping a layer of gritty sand and dirt from your hair. The air smells of sweat and blood. There are a number of hazards scattered around, like large logs bristling with spikes. The arena is filled with perhaps three dozen combatants, fighting alone or in small groups. Shouts, grunts, battle cries, and cursing fill the air. Fuck. You don’t remember it happening, but you must have been abducted and sold to a gladiator arena.
>
> After a moment, however, you realize that where you would expect to see open sky, you can see a metal and glass dome overhead, offering a view of stars and a planet. Between this sight and the fact that gravity doesn’t feel quite right, you are sure this is no sorcerer’s trick. Your first thought is that you have died and entered the realm of the gods, and are being forced to fight for their pleasure.
>
> But there are little hints that make you think this isn’t any sort of afterlife. Everything feels and smells too real for that. Plus, as you dodge an arrow flying your way, you notice it looks like this place wasn’t always a gladiator arena. If you didn’t know better, you’d guess it was a public park. There’s a small pond over there with a decorative bridge over it. The water is muddy and bloody now, but you can imagine it clean.
>
> Over on the far wall, there’s what looks like a doorway that has been sealed shut, and the sign mounted above it has been hastily painted over, but the paint is flaking off enough to make out that it said “Cargo Tunnel.” Now that you look around, you spot similar doors around the space. The one marked “Elevator” is closed and has a glowing red lock symbol on the wall near it. The one marked “Airlock” has been sealed shut with metal bars welded across. The only open door is the one marked “Security,” which is guarded a group of men, though you don’t recognize the type of armor they wear.
>
> There’s a loud squealing noise that fills the space, causing all fighting to halt, and everyone to wince. All eyes turn in your direction, though it takes you a moment to realize they are not looking at you, but at a large sign behind you. Turning to look, you see the sign is covered with moving words and pictures, and divided into several sections. On the left side of the sign is a constantly scrolling wall of text. It’s written in Common, but you can’t understand the most of the words. Perhaps some form of guild language or dialect? The only thing that makes sense is that the text is regularly interspersed with small pictograms of smiling or cheering faces. You get the impression that many hundreds of people are all somehow putting their thoughts on the sign.
>
> The rest of the sign is divided into a grid, showing moving images from various places around the arena. Looking back and forth, you suddenly realize that the images you see are being captured by a group of what you first assumed were birds, but can now see are some sort of automaton, each with one large eye in the middle of their head. They swoop around the arena, following particular fighters. You realize there are several pointed directly at you.
>
> One image in the grid does not show the arena, however. It shows the looming face of a male halfling wearing some sort of ornate uniform made from the most gaudy colors you’ve ever seen. His hair is slicked back, and his smile is almost painfully broad. As he speaks, the last lingering bits of combat die down.
>
> “Ladies and Gentlemen, I’m so glad you’ve chosen to join us this evening! It’s a very special night here on Historia Kanalo Arena Combat. Now, we’ve had some real bad hombres in here before. You know them, you love them, you love to watch them get killed. But joining us tonight? Ooooh, I get shivers just thinking about them. Joining our show with an exclusive contract — you won’t see them anywhere else! — are the most notorious criminals of all time. Introducing, for the first time in broadcast history: The MULMASTER COUNTY VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT!”
>
> As he says your group’s name, several things happen. Nearly every eye drone in the space turns to face you. The sound of air horns fills the air and confetti rains from the air. The pictograms on the board almost all change to jeering faces and thumbs-down signs, as well as other, more rude gestures.
>
> Most notably, however, every other gladiator turns on the spot and charges towards your group. Roll initiative.

This encounter starts in the heat of battle. The shock leaves the characters overwhelmed and struggling. If players try to make perception checks or learn more about their environment, push back on them a bit. They’re still groggy and disoriented. You can tell them that the area has clearly been an active combat zone for some time: It’s muddy and full of hazards, but there are some signs that this area had a different purpose at one time, perhaps as a public park. For example, a murky pond is crossed a cute stone bridge that seems out of place.

Let the players fight as hard as they like, but the deck is stacked overwhelmingly against them, and the other contestants are fighting to the death. Most likely, the players will eventually be overwhelmed and fall in combat, in which case you should proceed to Part 2 and have the characters wake up in the clone tanks.

If some or all of the characters somehow manage to survive, have a squad of security guards enter the arena and use their laser pistols to stun the remaining characters. Then proceed to Part 2, but have the surviving characters wake up in the holding cell.

## Arena Contestants

The Arena is filled with “contestants,” who have survived for some time in the Arena and see the characters as fresh meat. They use the stats for [Gladiators](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gladiator), and fight in packs of 1D4+1.

Despite using the same stat block, emphasize that the contestants vary wildly in appearance and weaponry. They appear to have been plucked from a wide variety of times and cultures. You might describe one as wearing a barbarian’s loincloth and swinging a battleaxe, while another is wearing a formal suit and fighting with a sword cane.
