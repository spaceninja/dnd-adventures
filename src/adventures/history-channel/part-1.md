The characters find themselves in a confusing new reality and are immediately caught up in an overwhelming battle.

## Into the Fray

When everyone is ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following aloud, then have everyone roll for initiative.

> You wake up on sandy ground with your head pounding. Wiping grit from your face, you take in your surroundings. The bright light hurts your eyes. The air is hot, and smells of sweat and blood. You and your group are in a circular holding pen formed by metal bars protruding from the earth.
>
> The area outside your cage looks like a battlefield. The uneven ground is broken up by small hills and the occasional dead tree or muddy pond. You can see several other holding pens, all filled with angry warriors. When they see you looking, they begin shouting threats and taunting you. Although you don't remember it happening, you can't escape the grim realization that you've been abducted and sold to a gladiator arena.
>
> High overhead, a colossal glass dome covers the entire arena. Through it, you see the night sky, crowded with stars, but something is wrong with the moon. It's much larger and brighter than usual, and the wrong color. It takes you a moment to realize those streaks of white are clouds, swirling over blue oceans and green land. Your head swims as your perspective adjusts. You're not looking _up_ at the moon, you're looking _down_ at the planet.
>
> A large black panel suspended from the dome crackles to life, revealing the leering face of a halfling. His hair is slicked back, and his smile is almost painfully broad.
>
> “Ladies and gentlemen of the audience, I’m so glad you’ve chosen to join us this evening! It’s a very special night here on Historia Kanalo Arena Combat. Now, we’ve had some real bad hombres in here before. You know them, you hate them, you love watching them fight and die. But joining us tonight? Ooooh, I get shivers just thinking about them. Joining our broadcast with an exclusive contract — you won’t see them anywhere else! — are the most notorious criminals of all time!”
>
> The halfling's triumphant face is replaced with a view of you and your group. The angle makes it clear it's being captured by something you assumed was a bird, but can now see is some sort of automaton, with one large eye in the middle of its head. There are dozens of them swooping around the arena, watching everything.
>
> "It's their first night here, so I hope our other contestants will help make it memorable. Now, with no further ado, let's COMMENCE! THE! CARNAGE!"
>
> The metal bars retract into the ground, and every other fighter in the arena charges straight for you.

### Features of the Area

The Arena is a large open space with a domed glass ceiling stretching high overhead revealing a view of a crowded sea of stars and the surface of the planet. The room has a dirt floor, but it's uneven, with small hills and valleys, even a few dead trees.

A DC 12 Perception check reveals that this space used to be some sort of park. There are still indications of it in the stone walls bordering what used to be a pond, or a small wooden bridge that has been uprooted for use as a barricade.

There are a number of hazards scattered around, like large logs bristling with spikes. The arena is filled with perhaps three dozen combatants, fighting alone or in small groups.

you see the sign is covered with moving words and pictures, and divided into several sections. On the left side of the sign is a constantly scrolling wall of text. It’s written in Common, but you can’t understand the most of the words. Perhaps some form of guild language or dialect? The only thing that makes sense is that the text is regularly interspersed with small pictograms of smiling or cheering faces. You get the impression that many hundreds of people are all somehow putting their thoughts on the sign.

This encounter starts in the heat of battle. The shock leaves the characters overwhelmed and struggling. If players try to make perception checks or learn more about their environment, push back on them a bit. They’re still groggy and disoriented. You can tell them that the area has clearly been an active combat zone for some time: It’s muddy and full of hazards, but there are some signs that this area had a different purpose at one time, perhaps as a public park. For example, a murky pond is crossed a cute stone bridge that seems out of place.

Let the players fight as hard as they like, but the deck is stacked overwhelmingly against them, and the other contestants are fighting to the death. Most likely, the players will eventually be overwhelmed and fall in combat, in which case you should proceed to Part 2 and have the characters wake up in the clone tanks.

If some or all of the characters somehow manage to survive, after an hour the broadcast ends, and a thick gas is released into the Arena rendering everyon unconsious. (If any characters are immune to poison, have a squad of security guards enter the arena and use their laser pistols to stun any characters left standing.) Then proceed to Part 2, but have the surviving characters wake up in the holding cell.

## Description of the Area

## Arena Contestants

The Arena is filled with “contestants,” who have survived for some time in the Arena and see the characters as fresh meat. They use the stats for [**Gladiators**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gladiator), and fight in six packs of five contestants each.

Despite using the same stat block, emphasize that the contestants vary wildly in appearance and weaponry. They appear to have been plucked from a wide variety of times and cultures. You might describe one as wearing a barbarian’s loincloth and swinging a battleaxe, while another is wearing a formal suit and fighting with a sword cane.

Each round during combat, add a new pack of five contestants to the encounter, all fighting the characters.

### DM Tips

**They can’t win.** Allow the characters to fight, but pull no punches. Let them die, and send them to the cloning vats once or twice to drive home how bad their situation is. It should be clear that continuing to fight is a losing proposition.

**The Director taunts them.** [The Director](../deck-4/#the-director)’s running commentary and the audience’s reactions on the board are powerful exposition tools. Make it clear to the players that they are regarded as notorious criminals, and the audience is rooting for them to be killed. Have the Director mock the characters for every missed attack, and the audience cheer when they’re hit.
