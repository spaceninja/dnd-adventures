The characters awaken in a holding cell (or a clone tank if they died), before they are returned to the arena for another round of combat. This repeats until the characters meet the Strategist, who shows them how to escape.

## Security

_Controlled by #TeamRatings_

- Exits:
  - Tunnel to Arena (guarded)
  - Hatch to Quarters (guarded)
  - Cargo Tunnel (guarded)
  - Elevator (locked)

Security is clean, well-lit, and orderly. Security Guards move through the area with purpose, supervised by the Security Chief. She can often be found in the control room, observing the banks of cameras and giving orders, but she’s not afraid to head into the field. The area has a barracks where the Security Guards sleep, as well as a set of interrogation rooms, holding cells, and offices. All exits from Security are well-guarded and the corridors are patrolled.

### Clone Room

Whenever a character is killed, they awaken in the Clone Room, falling out of a vat of pink goop, choking and sputtering. They vividly remember dying, and are surprised to find their bodies “reset” to how they looked when they arrived on the station. Guards immediately grab the character, who is too weak to resist, by the arms and haul them to the Brig. Over the next 15 minutes, the goop mostly dries and flakes off, and their strength returns, especially if they can get something to eat or drink. Their equipment will all be returned to them, though it may take more or less time depending on where and how they died.

### Brig

The brig is a large room with a plain metal floor, walls and ceiling with harsh light panels recessed into the ceiling. There are a set of benches affixed to the walls and a single toilet. The walls are covered with graffiti (perception 20: symbol of Bane), mostly rude comments about the Security Chief. There is dried blood on the floor that no one has bothered to clean.

Security Guards will mostly ignore characters in the Brig, but every evening they will come through and collect the prisoners and march them down the corridor, where they will be shoved unceremoniously back into the Arena, in time for that night’s broadcast.

#### Secret Hatch

There is a secret hatch under one of the benches. It has been hidden brilliantly, and the characters have no chance of finding it on their own. They will only be able to locate it if they are told of its existence by the Strategist. Once opened, it reveals a tight crawlspace that eventually drops the characters into the Locker Rooms at the Gym in the Crew Quarters.

### Security Guards

Security Guards wear anonymous riot cop-style gear, with face masks and helmets. While on-duty, they will be armed with (mostly) non-lethal weapons like stun batons and riot shields and will fight to subdue. However, if the characters resist too much or have gotten on the bad side of Security, they will escalate from cracking heads to shooting to kill.

Squads of Security Guards will be sent hunt the characters down if they’re loose in the station, and these squads should always show up at the most opportune moments to create the most chaos or disrupt the characters’ plans. However, they are not being paid enough to die, and if they sense the fight is going badly, they will retreat as a group, covering each other’s exits, so they can attack again in the future.

Security Guards use the stats for [Veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran), are armed with [Laser Pistols](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-pistol), and wear Security Armor, which is equivalent to Half Plate armor, but vulnerable to piercing damage since it’s designed to resist modern weaponry. Their weapons are biometrically locked, and will deliver a nasty shock to anyone else who tries to use them (which keeps the players from too easily acquiring powerful weaponry).

### The Security Chief

_Female Elf Fighter_

- Old, short, security armor
- Sarcastic, threatening
- Sounds like Lucille Bluth from Arrested Development
- Can be found in Security

The Security Chief is delighted with how things have turned out. She was never really happy running security for a calm and orderly tourist hub. In the course of keeping the arena “contestants” in line, she’s discovered a taste for sadistic abuse. After all, no one cares if you violate the rights of history’s most notorious criminals. And if a few prisoners die on her watch, it doesn’t really matter thanks to the clone vats.

She is always surrounded by a squad of at least as many Security Guards as there are characters (more if she feels threatened). She cannot be reasoned with, manipulated, or bribed. The current situation suits her just fine, and she will do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo.

The Security Chief uses the stats for a [Half-Red Dragon Veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/half-red-dragon-veteran), and carries a [Laser Rifle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/laser-rifle). (For the fire breath weapon, she has a one-shot flamethrower attached to her rifle.)

**Quote:** _“Can’t you idiots do anything right? Honestly, it’s one orc how hard can it be.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Defeat the Champion:** The Champion has become a real pain in the Security Chief’s rear, and if the opportunity arises, she may ask the characters to help take her down. In exchange, she offers better treatment while the characters are in custody. Better food, rest, respect. She may even be willing to look the other way when it comes to contraband or sneaking out into the main station, and may ask the Security Guards to go easy on the characters. This should be presented as a very non-committal you-scratch-my-back-maybe-I’ll-scratch-yours kind of thing. She thinks she has the upper hand and is not likely to negotiate.

_Female Hobgoblin Barbarian_

- Large, butch haircut, scarred armor with many kill marks
- Confident, loud, secretly sad
- Sounds like Kardala from the Adventure Zone
- Can be found in Arena

The Champion was a notorious marauder, and won the first season of the gladiator show. First prize that season was being returned to your timeline. She was brought back shortly after for an ill-considered All Stars episode.

Unfortunately, in her timeline, several years had passed, and she had given up her marauding ways and settled down with a nice human and had a couple kids. Then they abducted her again. She wants only to return to her timeline, but wasn’t sure how to do that until she met the Strategist. Now she has adopted the role of protector, trusting that the Strategist will find a way to get her home.

The Champion uses the stats for a [Hobgoblin Warlord](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin-warlord), and carries a [+2 Longsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5282-longsword-2).

**Quote:** _“I want only to return home to my small husband and our children. This tiny woman says she can free us, so I protect her. If you cross her, then I crush you.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Kill the Security Chief:** The Champion asks that you kill the Security Chief if you get the opportunity, to end her sadistic treatment of her prisoners.

If you do, she will reward you with her favorite weapon. (More importantly, it will reduce the effectiveness of all remaining security forces.)

_Female Human Ranger_

- Short, mousy, borrowed ill-fitting armor
- Distracted, annoyed, autistic
- Sounds like Laurie Bream from Silicon Valley
- Can be found in Arena

The Strategist was a war criminal who was expected to be killed quickly in the season she was brought aboard. However, Security didn’t watch her quite carefully enough, and she escaped into the station. She was eventually recaptured, but became a fan favorite when she started posting videos documenting what was happening on the station, which the Director happily allowed as the ratings climbed.

She claims to have a plan to stop what’s happening, but she is extremely difficult to communicate with. Mostly the Champion and her crew protect her as she pokes around various parts of the Arena, looking for weaknesses.

Secretly, she believes (based on some notes she stole from the Mad Scientist) that if they can blow up the station, it will destabilize the portal and “reset” everyone to their proper place in the timestream.

The Strategist uses the stats for a [Cultist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cultist).

**Quote:** _“Oh, um, while you’re inside, don’t use the computer to look yourself up. It’s… upsetting.”_

<aside class="block-torn-paper">

**Quest: Destroy the Station:** The Strategist lets you in on her plan: Based on some Mad Scientist notes she saw when she was loose in the station, she believes that causing the station to explode will send a ripple through space-time, effectively “resetting” all time travellers to their home time.

If you agree to help, she will tell you her secret route out of Security to access the rest of the station.
