##### Camera Drones

These drones are quadcopters about the size of a football. They have the equivalent of Perception +4, but theyâ€™re not very smart and can be tricked, misdirected, or avoided fairly easily (opposed Wisdom check: Wis 12, +1). If the characters successfully dodge all the drones following them, the drones will relocate them within 3D6 minutes.

They are extremely agile and will try to dodge any attempt to interfere with them. (Dex 18, +4) They can be disabled by submerging or dousing them with water, hitting them with electricity, or by a shot from a laser weapon in stun mode. If disabled, the drone falls out of the air and lays on the floor sparking and smoking until a cleaning drone comes to collect it. Disabled drones will be replaced within the hour, or the next time the characters enter contested or #TeamRatings territory.

They wear a cobbled-together collection of armor, mostly composed of 3D printed components, which is equivalent to scale mail, but resistant to radiant damage and vulnerable to piercing or slashing damage since it's designed to resist modern weaponry.
