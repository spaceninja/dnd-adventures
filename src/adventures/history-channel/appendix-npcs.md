##### Camera Drones

These drones are quadcopters about the size of a football. They have the equivalent of Perception +4, but they’re not very smart and can be tricked, misdirected, or avoided fairly easily (opposed Wisdom check: Wis 12, +1). If the characters successfully dodge all the drones following them, the drones will relocate them within 3D6 minutes.

They are extremely agile and will try to dodge any attempt to interfere with them. (Dex 18, +4) They can be disabled by submerging or dousing them with water, hitting them with electricity, or by a shot from a [**_laser weapon_**](../appendix-magic-items/#laser-weapon) in stun mode. If disabled, the drone falls out of the air and lays on the floor sparking and smoking until a cleaning drone comes to collect it. Disabled drones will be replaced within the hour, or the next time the characters enter contested or #TeamRatings territory.

### Security Guards

Security Guards wear anonymous riot cop-style gear, with face masks and helmets. While on-duty, they will be armed with (mostly) non-lethal weapons like stun batons and riot shields and will fight to subdue. However, if the characters resist too much or have gotten on the bad side of Security, they will escalate from cracking heads to shooting to kill.

Squads of Security Guards will be sent hunt the characters down if they’re loose in the station, and these squads should always show up at the most opportune moments to create the most chaos or disrupt the characters’ plans. However, they are not being paid enough to die, and if they sense the fight is going badly, they will retreat as a group, covering each other’s exits, so they can attack again in the future.

Security Guards use the stats for [**Veterans**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran), are armed with [**_Laser Pistols_**](../appendix-magic-items/#laser-weapon), and wear [**_Security Armor_**](../appendix-magic-items/#faction-armor). Their weapons are biometrically locked, and will deliver a nasty shock to anyone else who tries to use them (which keeps the players from too easily acquiring powerful weaponry).
